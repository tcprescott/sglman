"""Report users who participate in a community but are not members of it.

Read-only. Safe to run against production.

    poetry run python scripts/audit_membership_coverage.py

This is the go/no-go for closing the membership gate. Gating a community on
``TenantMembership`` locks out anyone the backfill missed, and the exposure is
specific: the multitenancy migration wrote a membership per user *at that
point*, and until the "a role implies membership" invariant landed, nothing
wrote one afterwards except the first-admin grant. So the people at risk are
accounts created since that migration who never received a role — ordinary
players and crew.

Run this, run ``scripts/backfill_memberships.py``, run this again. The second
run must report zero grantable gaps.

The audit-log signal is reported but never backfilled on: appearing in an audit
row can mean somebody acted *on* you, not that you belong. Read what it
surfaces that the others do not, by hand.
