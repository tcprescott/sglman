"""Crew signups — one row per state the crew cells can render.

Commentators and trackers are a two-party workflow with four transitions
(signup, approval, acknowledgment, withdrawal) and the schedule's crew cell
draws a different control for each. So each row here earns its place by being a
*state*, not a person: pending, approved-and-acknowledged, approved-but-not-yet,
and a fully crewed restream.

The approved-but-unacknowledged row is the one to keep: it is the only fixture
that renders the Acknowledge control and the "Approved, awaiting acknowledgment"
marker, and while the seed lacked it neither was reachable in a dev database
(docs/features/match-participation.md).

These rows now feed three surfaces, not one: the board's crew cells, Reports →
Crew Activity with its Pending-only filter (the unapproved rows), and **My Crew**
on Home (the volunteer's own view — ``players[0]``'s approved-but-unacknowledged
tracker slot on ``future`` is the fixture that renders its Confirm button).
