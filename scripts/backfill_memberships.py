"""Give everyone who participates in a community a ``TenantMembership``.

Run from the project root:
    poetry run python scripts/backfill_memberships.py [--dry-run]

Two populations need catching up, both created by the same gap: the
multitenancy migration wrote a membership per user *at that point*, and nothing
wrote one afterwards until the "a role in a tenant implies membership in it"
invariant landed.

- **Role holders** granted through the Users tab or the Discord role sync, both
  of which wrote a role and no membership.
- **Ordinary participants** — accounts created since that migration that never
  received a role: enrolled players, match players, crew signups, volunteers.
  These are the ones the membership gate would lock out.

The signals are defined in ``scripts/membership_coverage.py`` and shared with
``scripts/audit_membership_coverage.py``, so the report and the fix can never
disagree. The audit-log signal is deliberately **not** among them: appearing in
an audit row can mean somebody acted *on* you.

``SUPER_ADMIN`` is skipped: its ``UserRole`` carries ``tenant=NULL`` and it
belongs to no community.

Idempotent and safe to re-run; the membership gate's go/no-go re-runs it.
