"""Dev-seed fixtures for a **group play-in race** — the one shape that is not 1v1.

Split out of ``seed_dev.py`` like the other per-domain modules: called from
inside the caller's ``tenant_scope``, idempotent, tenant-stamped.

Head-to-head is what this app runs almost all of the time, so a whole tournament
of multi-racer heats would misrepresent it. What does happen is a staff-run
**play-in**: ten or more racers in one start list, whose finish order seeds the
bracket. It therefore lives *inside the tournament whose bracket it feeds*, which
also makes it the fixture for a tournament holding matches of two different
roster sizes — ``players_per_match`` is a single number, so production produces
exactly this mismatch too.

Three things nothing else in the seed covers:

* **A roster longer than two.** Ten names is where a two-player assumption shows
  — the roster editor, the "A vs B" labels, the crew DM copy, the Discord embed.
* **Non-finishers beside finishers.** Eight placings and two forfeits in one
  match: a forfeit keeps its seat with neither a rank nor a finish time, which is
  how every DNF is recorded.
* **A start list still filling.** The second group is scheduled with a partial
  roster, the state a play-in sits in until signups close.
