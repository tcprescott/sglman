"""Native-bracket fixtures for the dev seed (split out of seed_dev.py).

Must run inside the target tenant's ``tenant_scope`` — called from
``seed_for_tenant``. Idempotent like the rest of the seed.

B13 grows the original single stage into a set of per-format mid-play states plus
a two-stage group→playoff chain, driving the real :class:`BracketService`
(create → add entrant → enroll → start → report_result → complete_stage →
advance_stage) so every persisted graph is internally consistent — the same code
paths the admin tab, the public page, and the REST endpoints exercise.

Native brackets live on their **own** demo tournaments, never on the
Challonge-mirrored ``tournament`` the rest of the seed builds: the exclusivity
guard (``BracketService._ensure_no_challonge_link``) forbids a native bracket on
a Challonge-linked tournament, and the two integrations never both run one
tournament in production. Each demo tournament is guarded by an
"is stage 0 already built?" check so re-running the seed neither duplicates rows
nor double-reports a result.
