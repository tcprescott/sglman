"""One realistic match day, for the views that only make sense when it is busy.

**These rows are not state fixtures.** Every other seed module earns each row by
covering a distinct state; this one deliberately does the opposite — fifteen
ordinary bracket matches across the three stages, back to back through day one of
the event window, because a real event runs dozens of matches a day and the
schedule, the stage-utilisation report and the operations reports all render as
though nothing is happening when the database holds nine matches total.

Kept in its own module so the distinction stays visible: if this file is deleted,
no state goes uncovered — only the density does. Density beyond one day belongs
in ``scripts/loadtest``, not here (docs/reference/dev-seed.md).

The states follow the clock rather than being assigned: a slot that has already
passed is finished and confirmed, the slot containing *now* is racing, and the
rest are scheduled. That way the day reads correctly whenever the seed is run.
