"""Seed the dev database with test fixtures across **two** tenants.

Run from the project root:
    poetry run python scripts/seed_dev.py

Idempotent — safe to re-run; existing records are left unchanged.
Requires the schema to already exist (run ./start.sh dev or aerich upgrade first).

Users are global (no tenant FK): the same people log in everywhere and hold
per-tenant roles/memberships. Everything else is tenant-scoped, so the fixtures
are seeded once **per tenant** with ``tenant`` threaded through every scoped
create — giving leak tests and manual dev cross-tenant data from day one. Tenant
A adopts the ``default`` slug the migration backfills (created empty on a fresh
dev DB); tenant B is a second community.
