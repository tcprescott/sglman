"""Dev-seed fixtures for the online-tournament features (PRs 1-10).

Split out of ``seed_dev.py`` to keep that file under the length guideline. These
functions are called from ``seed_dev.py`` — they assume an open Tortoise
connection and (for the per-tenant helper) an active ``tenant_scope``.

The per-tenant helper owns a **dedicated racetime.gg-managed tournament** rather
than wiring the general-purpose "Wizzrobe Dev Tournament" to a bot. Attaching a
bot flips ``Tournament.is_racetime_enabled``, which hides every on-site proctor
control (check-in, stations, start, finish) on that tournament's matches and
drops them from the Proctor Station board — so a tournament cannot be both the
racetime fixture and the proctor-lifecycle fixture.

What they cover:

- **Presets** (PR 1) — per-tenant ``Preset`` rows, one assigned to the online
  tournament, plus placeholder ``RandomizerCredential`` rows for keyed backends.
- **Provider identities** (PR 2) — two players linked to racetime handles, one to
  a Twitch handle, and an assertion that ``player_three``/``player_four`` stay
  unlinked (the fixtures the account-link probes start from).
- **Racetime bots** (PR 3/4) — platform-level (no tenant FK), one connected and
  one parked in an error state so the ``/platform`` health table shows both.
- **Racetime config + rooms** (PR 3/4/6) — the online tournament's bot +
  auto-open config, its own matches, a room profile, and one race room per room
  lifecycle state.
- **SpeedGaming ETL** (PR 7) and the **Discord Events mirror** (PR 8), both
  hanging off the same online tournament.
- **Async qualifiers** (PR 9/10) live in ``seed_qualifiers.py``, called from here
  so they stay part of the same online fixture set.
