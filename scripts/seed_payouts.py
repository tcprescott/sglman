"""Dev seed for prize payouts.

Two states, because they are the two an admin actually sits in: last season's
event is paid out in full, and the running one has a pool with nobody placed
yet. The finished split reproduces SGL's ALTTPR 2025 arithmetic verbatim —
50/30/10/10 of a $1000 pool plus a $100 bonus, with **two** third places — so the
tie path and the ``$550 from a $1000 pool`` sum both have a fixture.

One of the four winners deliberately has no Matcherino handle, which is what
makes the export's missing-handle line visible in a running app.
