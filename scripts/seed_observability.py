"""Dev-seed fixtures for one tenant's outbound + telemetry surfaces.

Split out of ``seed_dev.py`` when that module crossed the 800-line budget,
following the ``seed_brackets_for_tenant`` / ``seed_challonge_for_tenant``
convention already used there: one module per domain, called from inside the
caller's ``tenant_scope``. Idempotent (``get_or_create`` / existence-guarded)
and tenant-stamped like every other seeded row.

The audit-log fixtures deliberately stayed behind in ``seed_dev.py``: they
reference half a dozen other seeded rows (a proctor, an equipment card, a
tournament), and threading all of those through here would cost more clarity
than the split buys.
