"""Dev seed for the second on-site (non-racetime) tournament — "Wizzrobe Cup".

Split out of ``seed_dev.py`` for length, the way the volunteer and bracket
fixtures already are.

A venue event distinct from the general-purpose "Wizzrobe Dev Tournament": it
carries its own per-tournament "tournament days" override, and it walks the
proctor's board through the workflow in order — one match per step, plus the two
states the admin's half of the loop needs (a recorded result awaiting review, and
a finished match with no winner recorded). Deliberately never racetime-enabled:
a racetime bot hides check-in, stations, start and finish, which is exactly what
this fixture exists to exercise.
