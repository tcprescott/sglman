"""Keep the anonymous, publicly-cacheable responses free of per-visitor state.

``pages/static_brackets.py`` serves the spectator bracket views with
``Cache-Control: public`` so a browser — or a CDN in front of the app — can hand
the same bytes to everyone. NiceGUI's session middleware, however, mints a
session cookie on *every* request that reaches the app, this one included. A
``public`` response carrying a ``Set-Cookie`` is a cache-poisoning hazard: a
shared cache that stored it would hand one visitor's session cookie to every
subsequent reader.

So this middleware strips ``Set-Cookie`` from exactly those responses. It has to
run **outside** the session middleware to do it — NiceGUI adds that one itself,
outermost of the app's own stack, and appends the cookie on the way out — which
is why it is installed on the wrapping FastAPI app in ``frontend.init`` rather
than alongside the tenant/auth middlewares.

Nothing is lost by dropping it: these pages never read the session (they render
identically for everyone, signed in or not), and any other page the visitor
opens mints the cookie as usual.

Pure ASGI, matching on the path only, so it costs a regex per request and
touches nothing else.
