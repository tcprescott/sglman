"""Tenant resolution middleware (path mode + host mode).

Every tenant is reachable at ``https://<platform>/t/<slug>/…``. In **path mode**
this middleware resolves the slug to a :class:`~models.Tenant`, sets the
request-time tenant context, and **rewrites the ASGI scope** so the app's single
set of unprefixed routes serve the request: ``/t/<slug>`` is stripped from
``scope['path']`` and appended to ``scope['root_path']``, so downstream routing
matches ``/admin`` while redirects and ``url_for`` built from ``root_path`` keep
the ``/t/<slug>`` prefix.

In **host mode** a request whose (normalized) ``Host`` matches a tenant's custom
``domain`` resolves to that tenant with the scope **left untouched**: the whole
host is the tenant, so the unprefixed routes already match and ``root_path``
stays empty (absolute links remain bare paths on-host). Host mode is checked
first and is authoritative for a custom domain — a stray ``/t/<other>`` there is
left literal and 404s, so one domain serves exactly one tenant. Path mode stays
authoritative on the platform host, where every tenant is reachable at
``/t/<slug>`` regardless of any domain. An unknown host falls through leniently
to the platform surface (a rate-limited warning flags a likely proxy misconfig).

Requests with neither a matching custom host nor a ``/t/`` prefix run with **no**
tenant context: that is the platform surface (landing page, ``/platform``, the
shared OAuth callbacks). Tenant pages guard themselves — ``@protected_page``
returns 404 when reached with no tenant.

Transport/API paths (``/_nicegui``, ``/static``, ``/sw.js``, ``/api``) are
tenant-agnostic and skipped: the REST API derives its tenant from the bearer
token, and websocket/asset traffic carries no tenant of its own.

Ordering: added in ``frontend.py`` after ``AuthMiddleware`` so it wraps auth
(Starlette runs last-added outermost) — tenant context and the path rewrite
happen before authentication reads the (already-rewritten) path.

    NiceGUI derives its client asset + websocket URL prefix from the page's
    ``root_path`` (``/t/<slug>`` in path mode), so a tenant page tells the browser
    to load ``/t/<slug>/_nicegui/…`` and open ``/t/<slug>/_nicegui_ws/…``. Those
    resources are shared, served by the app's *unprefixed* routes, so the prefix
    must be removed — with ``root_path`` left empty, exactly like a bare-host
    asset request (a non-empty ``root_path`` makes NiceGUI's static route 404).

    This is a **pure ASGI** middleware, not ``BaseHTTPMiddleware``, so it also
    handles the ``websocket`` scope — ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` silently passes
    websockets through untouched, which is why the socket.io connection to
    ``/t/<slug>/_nicegui_ws/…`` would otherwise never be stripped and 404. It
    sets no tenant context (assets carry no tenant; the UI's tenant is resolved
    from the per-client stash written at page build).
