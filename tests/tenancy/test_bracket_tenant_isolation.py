"""Cross-tenant isolation (leak) tests for the native bracket models.

All four models — Bracket, BracketEntrant, BracketEntry, BracketMatch — carry a
``tenant`` FK, so a tenant-scoped read must return only that tenant's rows. B0
has no repository yet (that arrives in B6); these tests exercise the same
``scoped()`` helper the repositories will use, which is what enforces the
contract in production.
