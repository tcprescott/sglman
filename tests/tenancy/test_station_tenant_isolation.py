"""Cross-tenant isolation for the venue station pool and station occupancy.

``Station.name`` is unique *per tenant*, so two communities routinely name a
station ``1``. Two things must therefore be tenant-scoped:

- the pool itself (``StationRepository``), or one community's admin surface
  would list another's seats and its validation would accept them; and
- **occupancy** (``MatchRepository.occupied_stations``), which is derived from
  live matches. Unscoped, two communities running events at the same time would
  block each other's station assignments — the sharpest leak here, since the
  rejection would look like a legitimate double-booking.
