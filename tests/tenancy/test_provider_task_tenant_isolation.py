"""Tenant isolation for :class:`ProviderTask`.

A provider task carries an upstream handle, the settings that were sent, and the
match the resulting seed belongs to. A read that crossed tenants would let one
community's board claim another's in-flight roll — and, because completing a
task records a seed and DMs the players, deliver one community's seed into
another's match.

The worker's own scan is deliberately cross-tenant (it owns the whole queue),
so the test that matters is that it re-enters each task's tenant before acting,
and that every request-facing read stays scoped.
