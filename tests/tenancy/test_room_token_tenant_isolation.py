"""Cross-tenant isolation for tournament-room kiosk tokens.

A ``RoomToken`` is resolved from a URL under ``/t/<slug>/room/…``, so the
community is already bound when the lookup runs and the lookup is scoped to it.
That is what makes the wrong-community case a plain "not found" rather than a
check someone has to remember to write — this pins it, along with the three
other ways a token fails to open anything.
