"""Membership is real: the invariant, the community user list, and the pickers.

The invariant is *"holding any role in a tenant implies membership in that
tenant"*. Membership was a frozen backfill until this wave — the migration wrote
a row per existing user and nothing wrote one since, so a staff member granted
through the Users tab was not a member of the community they administered.
Scoping a picker on that hides a community's own staff from its own selects;
gating on it locks them out entirely.
