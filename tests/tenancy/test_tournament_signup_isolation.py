"""Cross-tenant isolation for player self-service tournament signup.

``TournamentPlayers`` reached from a global ``User`` spans every community that
user plays in, so the two reads the Tournaments tab makes —
``enrolled_tournament_ids`` and ``entrants_by_tournament`` — are the sharp edges:
un-scoped, a player enrolled in tenant B's tournament would see themselves
marked "Signed up" on a same-named tournament in tenant A, and each card would
list the other community's entrants.
