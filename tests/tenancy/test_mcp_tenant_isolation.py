"""Tenant isolation for the MCP surface.

The REST API gets most of this for free: its tenant is derived from the token
and bound by a router-level dependency that resets in a ``finally``. MCP has no
such dependency — one platform-wide token can name a different community on
every call — so the binding is done per call in ``mcpserver/registry.py`` and
has to be proved here rather than assumed.

Two families of assertion:

* **Scoping** — a call naming community A never returns community B's rows.
* **Hygiene** — the binding is released after every call, and interleaved calls
  on one connection do not inherit each other's community. This is the part
  that would silently pass with a broken implementation if it were only ever
  exercised one call at a time.
