"""Structural + simulation invariants for the double-elimination engine.

Every generated graph must validate, and playing it out under a variety of
deterministic winner-pick policies must always yield exactly one champion, every
other entrant eliminated with exactly two losses, no self-pairings, a reset
contested iff the losers-bracket side won the first grand final, and the right
total number of contested matches.
