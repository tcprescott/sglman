"""The reads the admin drill-down was split onto.

Both exist because the Qualifiers drill-down used to load seven datasets on every
mutation: a leaderboard read that projects instead of hydrating, and a per-runner
outcome tally that scales with the review queue rather than with the tournament.
Split from ``test_async_qualifier_service.py`` when that file crossed the 800-line
guideline.
