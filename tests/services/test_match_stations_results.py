"""The on-site desk, against a real database: where players sit, and who won.

Split from ``test_match_service.py`` when that module approached the 800-line
guideline. The split is along the seam that was already there: everything left
in the sibling drives a ``MatchService`` whose repositories are mocks, and
everything here needs real rows — the station validation ladder reads the
tenant's station pool and derives occupancy from *other* matches, and the result
assertions are about what was persisted.

Both halves cover code that now lives in mixins (``StationAssignmentMixin``,
``match_service``'s result path); they are composed into ``MatchService``, so
the tests still drive the one service class.
