"""The qualifier fixtures the AsyncQualifierService test modules share.

``test_async_qualifier_service`` (draw, run lifecycle, review, scoring,
lockdown) and ``test_async_qualifier_availability`` (why a run cannot be
started) were one module until it approached the 800-line guideline. These four
helpers are what both need, and what a third module would otherwise copy:

``submit_run`` refuses a claim longer than the run has existed — the server
stamps ``started_at`` at the draw and measures against it — so ``submit``
backdates the draw rather than each test remembering to. The two user factories
are ``make_``-prefixed because their callers bind the result to ``staff`` and
``player``, and a bare name would be shadowed by the first assignment.
