"""The bracket ↔ scheduled-match seam (docs/plans/bracket-match-integration-plan.md).

DB-backed (the ``db`` fixture: in-memory SQLite, default tenant id 1). Four units
meet here, and each has a failure mode that is silent in production:

* **U3a** — a cancelled best-of-1 used to strand its matchup as permanently
  unschedulable, invisible to the player dashboard *and* to staff. The first test
  in :class:`TestReleaseOnCancel` is that regression stated as an assertion.
* **U3b** — rewriting a ``Match``'s ranks after its game settled would leave the
  bracket advanced on the old answer, with nothing saying so.
* **U2** — the live status the bracket paints must come from the ``Match``, in a
  fixed number of queries however big the field is.
* **U5** — the matchup-ready DM must fire once per matchup, and must *not* fire
  for advancement or elimination.
