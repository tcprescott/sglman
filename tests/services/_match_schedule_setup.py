"""The service double and row helpers the MatchScheduleService tests share.

Three modules cover this service — ``test_match_schedule_service`` (the
lifecycle transitions and message builders), ``test_match_schedule_coverage``
(seeding and the confirm/Challonge push) and
``test_match_schedule_notifications`` (the fan-out helpers) — and the last two
were one file until it crossed the 800-line guideline. The fixture lives here so
the split did not fork it: a stub that drifts between two halves of the same
suite is worse than the length it was meant to fix.
