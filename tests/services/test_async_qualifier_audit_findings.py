"""Failing tests for the open findings of the async-qualifier leaderboard audit.

Each test pins one defect recorded in
[docs/reviews/async-qualifier-leaderboard-ux.md](../../docs/reviews/async-qualifier-leaderboard-ux.md)
and asserts the behaviour that finding says it *should* have. They are expected to
fail until the corresponding wave ships — that is the point: the audit's method
was to probe the running app, and a probe script is thrown away while a test is
not. Each carries its finding id so a fix can find its target.

The four policy questions the audit raised were settled with the maintainer, and
these tests encode those answers rather than the current behaviour:

- a slot spent on a forfeit or rejection counts as a **realised zero** (F4b),
- a racer exceeding ``runs_per_pool`` in a live race is **recorded as voided** (F10a),
- live-race and self-paced runs share **one board**, with slot counting fixed (F4a),
- a runner's Score **coarsens to three bands** while the window is open (F7).

Each still-open finding is marked ``xfail(strict=True)`` so the suite stays green
today and *fails loudly the moment a fix lands without the marker being removed* —
which is the reminder to delete the marker rather than the test. A test with no
marker is one whose finding has shipped; it now guards the fix.

Waves 1 and 2 (F1-F3) were performance and had no assertions here. Wave 3 closed
F4a-e and F10a-b, so those markers are gone and their tests pass. Still xfailing:
F5 (three cases), F6, and F12 (two cases).
