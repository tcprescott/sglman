"""Tests for the SpeedGaming transport client's handling of the live API's quirks.

SG publishes no schema. These pin the behaviours captured from the live feed —
a JSON error object served with a 200, and canned fixtures whose shape matches
the ``SG_*_KEYS`` manifests exactly, so the mock cannot drift into a shape the
real API never serves.
