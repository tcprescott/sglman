"""The DMs a stage assignment sends, and who gets them.

``MatchService.assign_stage`` used to change a row and refresh an open page:
the two people it most concerns learned about it when somebody walked over and
told them. These drive the real fan-out against the in-memory ORM — the audience
(players and *approved* crew), the retraction when a stage is cleared, the
reminder stamp that re-arms on every change, and the link each DM carries.
