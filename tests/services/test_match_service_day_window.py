"""What "a day" means is a display-clock decision, and it lives in the service.

``MatchService.get_matches_for_date`` turns a picked date into the half-open
instant window the repository queries. Getting that wrong is invisible: the page
renders, the table fills, and only the matches near either midnight are missing
or wrong.

Regression: the bounds were once built with a bare ``datetime.combine``, whose
naive result the ORM reads as UTC — so "March 10" selected 00:00–23:59 *UTC*. In
Eastern that dropped the evening (19:00 ET onward is already the 11th in UTC) and
wrongly pulled in the previous evening.
