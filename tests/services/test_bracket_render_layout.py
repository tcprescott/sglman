"""Integration check: the bracket layout walker vs. real engine-generated graphs.

The pure walker unit tests (tests/theme/test_bracket_layout.py) use hand-built
trees; this drives the actual ``BracketService`` (byes, the irregular double-elim
losers bracket, the grand final + reset) and asserts the walker places every
match exactly once in its section with no in-column overlap, centers parents on
their feeders, and numbers matches uniquely. It lives under tests/services (it
exercises the service) — the walker under test is theme/brackets/layout.py.
