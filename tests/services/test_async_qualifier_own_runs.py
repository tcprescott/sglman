"""What a runner may see of their own runs, and what the surface owes them.

The audit's F7 and F8. F7: an exact score is exactly solvable for the seed's par —
the runner knows their own elapsed time — so publishing it during the window hands
every runner the number the lockdown exists to hide. F8: the record already held
the seed played, why a reviewer voided a run, and whether the clock or the runner
ended it, and none of it reached a screen.

``list_user_runs`` answers both by projecting to ``OwnRun``, so the page and
``GET /{id}/me/runs`` share one decision instead of each reading ``run.score``.
