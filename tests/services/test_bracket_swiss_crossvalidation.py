"""Cross-validate our Swiss engine against bbpPairings (a real FIDE-grade Dutch
engine) at the level of *hard constraints*, not identical output.

bbpPairings implements the Dutch system, so its pairings differ from our
``swisspair``-based engine's. What both must nonetheless satisfy for the same
tournament state is a set of hard constraints: no rematch against pairing
history, at most one bye, and every active player paired exactly once. Serializing
each scenario to TRF(x), feeding it to the real binary, and checking that both
engines' pairings are legal proves (a) our TRF round-trips through a genuine FIDE
parser and (b) both engines legally pair the same instance.

The always-run tests need no binary: they check the TRF serialization shape and
that our engine pairs every scenario legally. The binary-gated tests run only
when ``BBPPAIRINGS_BIN`` points at a built ``bbpPairings`` executable.
