"""The audit's F14 — what a webhook subscriber can learn about a qualifier.

Four `EventType` members covered run submitted, reviewed, expired and live-race
recorded. Nothing published when the qualifier itself **opened** — the announcement
a Discord integration would most want to make — nor when a runner forfeited or
voided a run, both of which move a standing exactly as an expiry does.

The window is a state, not an edit: `opens_at` was set weeks ago by a PATCH that
also touched six other fields, and the crossing happens later with no request in
flight. So it is observed and published once, stamped on the qualifier so a worker
tick that changes nothing says nothing.
