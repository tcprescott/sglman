"""A script the test suite imports must not push the dev ``.env`` into os.environ.

``scripts/seed_dev.py`` is imported by several tests (they call ``seed_all``
against the in-memory DB). It used to call ``load_dotenv()`` at module import,
which loaded the developer's ``.env`` — including ``MOCK_DISCORD=true`` and
``MOCK_SEEDGEN=true`` — into ``os.environ`` for the whole pytest worker process.

Under ``--dist loadfile`` that poisons every *later* file on the same worker:
``test_async_qualifier_service.py``'s "rolling without a DK64 key must raise"
stopped raising, because mock seedgen skips the credential check. It presented
as an intermittent failure whose identity depended on which worker happened to
pick up a seeding test first.

The flag any test asserts on must come from that test, not from whoever imported
a script earlier.
