"""Guards against re-introducing a per-test rebuild of an expensive fixture.

The suite's wall time is dominated by fixture *setup*, not by assertions — test
*count* is close to free by comparison. See docs/development.md > "Keeping it
fast" for the numbers.

Five things are therefore built once per process and shared, each of them once
the most expensive item in the run:

* ``build_api_app()`` (``tests/api_helpers.py``) — mounting the API router costs
  ~200ms, because ``include_router`` resolves each route's dependency graph and
  builds a Pydantic response model per endpoint. Exposed as the ``app`` fixture
  in ``tests/conftest.py``.
* ``_schema_sql()`` (``tests/conftest.py``) — the CREATE TABLE script, rendered
  once and replayed instead of re-derived from model metadata.
* **The engine** (``_bootstrap_engine()``) — ``Tortoise.init()`` spends most of
  its ~15ms in ``_build_initial_querysets()``, rebuilding a filter map for all
  ~70 models. Per test that was 60s of a 190s profiled run. Now once per worker,
  with each test restoring a pristine **template** database instead.
* **The MCP catalogue** (``tests/mcp/conftest.py``) — ``build_server()`` derives
  a JSON schema per tool and costs ~230ms; ~106 sessions rebuilt it.
* **The dev seed** (the ``seeded_db`` fixture) — ``seed_all()`` costs ~1.5s and
  eight tests want its result, not its execution.

The checks here are **structural, not timing-based** — a wall-clock budget is
flaky on shared CI runners, and a flaky guard gets deleted. Two kinds: identity
assertions that the caches are still in place, and a single AST pass over
``tests/`` for the shapes that were removed.

``.claude/scripts/check_fixture_cost.py`` blocks the same shapes at write time,
but only for edits Claude Code makes; this module is the layer that binds an IDE
edit or an externally-authored PR, so it is the one that holds the line.
