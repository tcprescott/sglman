"""The migration advisory lock, against a real PostgreSQL.

``tests/utils/test_migration_lock.py`` proves the lock is *asked for* — it fakes
asyncpg and asserts the statements. It cannot prove the lock excludes anything,
because on SQLite there is no lock manager to exclude with. That is the only
property that matters here, so it needs the real backend.

Run with:

    WIZZROBE_TEST_DB_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/db \\
