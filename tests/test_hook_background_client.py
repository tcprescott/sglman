"""Guardrail: ``check_slot_context.py`` catches a background task fetching its own client.

The hook's second check, added after a UX audit found the shape live. A
coroutine handed to ``background_tasks.create(...)`` runs with an empty slot
stack, so ``context.client`` **raises** rather than returning ``None`` — a
handler that opens with ``client = context.client`` dies on its first statement,
before doing anything, with nothing on screen to say so. My Crew's ``acknowledge``
and ``withdraw`` were both written that way, so the volunteer's *Confirm I can
cover this* and *Withdraw* had never worked from the page built to give them one.

The hook's first check (an unguarded ``ui.*`` call) does not see it: the
offending line looks like a perfectly ordinary capture, and it is often followed
by a correct ``with client:`` block that satisfies check 1 completely.

Assertions run the hook's real ``check()`` against source fragments, so they
survive a refactor of its internals.
