"""Recording a winner takes two taps, not one.

Every other lifecycle step asks before it acts — check-in, start and confirm all
open a confirmation. Recording the winner was the exception: on the two-player
path (the common one, and the one that happens under time pressure in a room)
tapping a name committed immediately, settling the match and advancing the
bracket, and a proctor has no way to undo it — the pencil is admin-only.

Rendering needs a live NiceGUI client, so these lock the state machine and the
wiring that ``open()`` builds on.
