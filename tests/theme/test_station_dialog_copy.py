"""``StationAssignmentDialog``'s two copy modes.

The same dialog does two jobs: the proctor's check-in (seat the players, then
the caller checks the match in) and correcting the stations of a match that is
already checked in. The check-in mode has to say "check in" — the audit found a
dialog that never mentioned the thing it was doing — and the stations mode must
not claim to check anything in, because in that mode nothing is checked in.

Rendering the dialog needs a live NiceGUI client, so this locks the copy table
and the constructor state ``open()`` reads from it.
