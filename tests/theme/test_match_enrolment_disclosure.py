"""Scheduling a match into a tournament enrols the players — say so.

Measured: ticking "Choose any players" turned the Players select from 0 options
into every account on the platform, and creating the match silently enrolled
whoever was chosen. The notification said "Match created successfully" and
nothing else.

Wave 2 fixed *who* is offered. This is *what happens next*: a caption before the
save and a report after it. No confirmation dialog — enrolment is reversible
from the tournament's own entrants dialog, and a modal would tax the common path
to guard a cheap mistake.
