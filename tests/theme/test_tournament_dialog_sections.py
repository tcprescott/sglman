"""The Add Tournament form: one required field, everything else deferred.

Measured at 1,730 px tall with 21 inputs, 4 selects and 5 checkboxes — of which
exactly one is required. The problem was never the fields; it was that nothing
distinguished "fill this now" from "come back to this when you care", so typing
a name and saving looked like the riskiest option rather than the cheapest
correct one.

Rendering the dialog needs a live NiceGUI client, so this reads the source: that
the optional fields are behind expansions, that those are collapsed on create
and open on edit, and — the one worth automating — that no second field has
quietly become required inside a collapsed section, where nobody would see it.
