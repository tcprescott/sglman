"""The health board's per-row route out of the problem it just named.

The tenant board reports Challonge · *Credential warning* · "Token expiring
soon", under a blurb that says to "reconnect before it becomes an outage" — and
offered no link to the tab where reconnecting happens. That is the same finding
the admin-reports audit shipped a fix for, in a place that audit did not reach.

The rule is deliberately narrow, and these tests pin the narrowness: only a row
a *tenant's* staff can actually act on gets a link. A racetime bot is
platform-managed, so a link from a community's board would land them on a page
that cannot fix it.
