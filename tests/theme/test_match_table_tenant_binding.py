"""A table event handler that touches tenant-scoped data must keep its context.

``MatchTableView`` captures the request's tenant *and display zone* at
construction and rebinds both in ``_bg``. A handler scheduled with a bare
``background_tasks.create`` instead loses them: it dies on
``require_tenant_id()`` — silently, because the exception surfaces in a
background task rather than the UI — or, worse, survives and repaints every
timestamp on the fallback clock. ``assign_stations`` regressed the first way;
this pins both halves of the wiring.
