"""Two admin-toolbar defects the audit found, and the guards against their return.

Both were *silent*: the control rendered, the click did nothing, and the only
evidence was a line in the server log.

1. **A hidden column is not hidden.** ``{'hidden': True}`` is this app's own
   column convention. ``mobile_grid`` honours it when building the phone card;
   Quasar's ``QTable`` has no such property and painted the column anyway, so
   six admin tables printed a raw primary key as their first desktop column
   while correctly hiding it on a phone. ``apply_column_visibility`` translates
   the convention into Quasar's ``visible-columns``.

2. **A refresh button spawned from a click loses its tenant.** A task created in
   a client event handler has neither the tenant contextvar nor the client stash
   the fallback reads, so the first scoped query inside raises and NiceGUI
   swallows it. Eleven of fifteen admin refresh controls were dead this way.
   ``refresh_button`` captures the render context at build time.

The source scan is the part that matters: a *new* tab that hand-rolls either
pattern is the regression, and only a scan can see it.
