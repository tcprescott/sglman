"""The phone bottom bar renders only where the whole nav fits in it.

It used to show `tabs[:4]` on every hub and hide the rest behind a **More**
button. On Admin — twenty-seven tabs — that spent 72px of phone screen offering
four of them picked by list order, plus a button that is the drawer with an extra
tap. Where the nav does not fit, the drawer is the honest answer.

These assert the decision, not the rendering: `_render_footer` needs a NiceGUI
client, so the rule is checked through the same predicate the method uses.
