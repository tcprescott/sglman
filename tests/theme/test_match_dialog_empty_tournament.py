"""The Tournament select when a community has no tournaments.

Measured on a new community: the required select opened no menu at all (zero
options, no "none yet" row) and Create Match answered "Please fill required
field(s): Tournament" — a control that cannot succeed and does not say why.

Rendering the select needs a live NiceGUI client, so this locks the two pieces
that are inspectable without one: that the helper takes an audience-specific
hint at all, and that both call sites pass a distinct one.
