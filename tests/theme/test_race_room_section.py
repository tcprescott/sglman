"""The match dialog's Racetime Room section, once a room exists.

It used to be a dead end: ``f'{room.slug} — {room.status.value}'`` and a
``return``. The slug was not a link, the status was the raw enum the bot writes,
and ``RaceRoomService.cancel_room`` — reachable over REST and covered by tests —
had no web surface at all, so calling off a room opened by mistake meant the API
or racetime.gg itself.

Rendering needs a live NiceGUI client, so these lock the parts that decide what
the section says and offers.
