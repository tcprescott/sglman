"""My Schedule's section panels, and the Event tab's view switcher.

Both surfaces regressed the same way — presentation the Python suite cannot
render, so the defect lived in a prop string and a stack of margin classes until
someone opened a browser.

*The switcher*: ``ui.toggle(...).props('color=primary')`` sets the **inactive**
background on a ``q-btn-toggle``. All three segments came out gold, so no option
looked chosen — Brackets and Schedule rendered pixel-identical.

*The panels*: four sections stacked with ``page-container`` + ``header-row`` +
``separator-spacing`` each, which is ~4em of dead space between every title and
its own content and no visible boundary at all between one section and the next.

Both are pinned by source inspection rather than a render, for the reason
``test_home_nav`` gives: assembling these pages needs a request, a tenant and a
signed-in user, none of which this test has or needs.
