"""Every tenant-scoped model must appear in a tenant-isolation (leak) test.

The multitenancy contract (CLAUDE.md) requires a leak test when adding a
tenant-scoped model; this ratchet makes that mechanical. A model counts as
covered when its class name appears (word-bounded) in any ``tests/*isolation*``
file. Models that predate the rule sit in BACKLOG with a reason — and the
companion test guarantees the backlog only ever shrinks: a model that gains a
leak test (or is deleted) must leave it.
