"""Guardrail: every check in ``.claude/scripts/`` is accounted for in CI.

The hooks fire on a Write/Edit inside a Claude session and nowhere else, so
``scripts/guardrails.py`` replays them against files on disk for everyone else.
A check that exists but is not listed there is enforced for exactly one author
on exactly one tool — the failure mode is silent, because nothing goes red.

So the invariant is coverage, not correctness: each script must be replayed, or
be named in ``EXCLUDED_CHECKS`` with a reason. Adding a hook without touching
either fails here.
