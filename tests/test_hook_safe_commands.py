"""Guardrail: ``enforce_safe_commands.py`` blocks the right commands in the right place.

Most rows in the hook's ``RULES`` table are unconditional. The database-drop row
is not: it exists to protect a developer's real, long-lived dev database, and a
remote session (Claude Code on the web) has no such thing — it gets a fresh
container and a scratch Postgres that setup routinely tears down and rebuilds.
Enforcing it there blocks legitimate work and protects nothing.

The trigger strings are assembled from fragments so this file does not trip the
hook that reads it, and the assertions are behavioural (exit code of the real
script) so they survive a refactor of the rule table.
