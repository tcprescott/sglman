"""Cross-tenant isolation (leak) tests for the PR 7 SpeedGaming models.

``SpeedGamingEventLink`` and ``SpeedGamingEpisode`` are tenant-scoped, so each
tenant must see only its own rows. The worker's ``list_active_all`` scan is
deliberately **unscoped** (a timer has no ambient tenant), so it resolves
cross-tenant on purpose — that behavior is asserted too.
