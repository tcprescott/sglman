"""Per-community event information: the shipped handbook for one tenant's event.

The counterpart to ``application/help``. Help explains **the app** and reads the
same for every community; this explains **the event** — when things happen, what
to bring on the day, who to find when something goes wrong — and belongs to one
community. Keeping them apart is the point: event logistics in the help articles
would go stale on a different clock and dilute what help is for.

A peer of ``application/services``: no database, no rules, just the tenant→
directory resolution. Which articles a reader may see is a rule and lives in
``application.services.EventInfoService``.
