"""In-process pub/sub for live match-change notifications.

Services publish a match change here after committing it; the presentation layer
(see ``theme/realtime.py``) subscribes per browser client to push updates into
open views. This module deliberately has **no** NiceGUI import so it stays usable
from the service layer without violating the three-layer boundary.

Subscriber callbacks are plain callables ``(match_id, change_type) -> None`` and
must be fast and non-blocking — they should only *schedule* work, never await it.
``publish`` swallows per-subscriber exceptions so one bad subscriber can't break
the others or the mutating service call.
