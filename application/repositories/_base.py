"""Generic tenant-scoped CRUD base for the repository layer.

Most repositories persist a single tenant-scoped model with the same four
shapes: a tenant-stamped ``create``, a scoped ``get_by_id``, a setattr-loop
``update``, and a ``delete``. Those live here once, mirroring the ``Generic[T]``
pattern already proven in ``_crew_repository.py``. A concrete repository binds
``model`` and inherits whatever it does not need to specialise; it overrides any
method whose query differs — an extra ``prefetch_related``, a different lookup
shape, or (for a deliberately *global* model like ``User``, ``Tenant``,
``RacetimeBot`` or ``FeatureFlagGroup``) an unscoped ``create``/``get_by_id`` so
no tenant filter is ever applied to a table that has no tenant column.

Reads stay tenant-scoped and writes stay tenant-stamped exactly as before via the
``_tenant`` helpers; this is pure de-duplication, not a behaviour change.

Methods are ``classmethod``s so a subclass may be used both as a class of static
lookups (``TournamentRepository.update(...)``) and as an instance
(``PresetRepository().update(...)``) — the two calling conventions the existing
repositories use interchangeably.
