"""Randomizer credential registry — which secret each randomizer's upstream needs.

A randomizer whose upstream API is key-gated cannot be rolled until the community
supplies **its own** credential (stored per tenant as a ``RandomizerCredential``
row). This module is the single declaration of which credentials exist, so the
admin surface, the "can this community select this randomizer?" check, and the
roll-time resolution all read one list instead of a chain of ``if``s.

Pure metadata — a peer of ``application/feature_flags``: it imports nothing from
``application.services`` or ``models``, so every layer may import it freely.

**Adding a credential:** add a :class:`CredentialSpec` under its randomizer, then
read it in the generator with ``SeedGenerationService._credential(randomizer, key)``.
``key`` is the stable value persisted on ``RandomizerCredential.key``, so renaming
one is a data migration.
