"""Feature-flag registry — the catalog of per-tenant feature flags.

A feature flag exists only when a feature is deliberately gated behind one; this
is **not** a per-feature switch for everything the app does. Flags default OFF
and are governed two-tier:

* a **super-admin** makes a flag *available* to a tenant on ``/platform``; then
* that tenant's **STAFF** *enable* it for their community (Admin → Features).

Effective state = ``available AND enabled`` (see ``FeatureFlagService``).

This module is pure metadata — a peer of ``application/events`` and
``application/tenant_context`` (import-safe from every layer, including
repositories and pages). The stable enum keys live in
:class:`models.enums.FeatureFlag`; the human copy and grouping live here so the
UI and the migration/seed have one source of truth.

**Adding a flag:** add a member to :class:`~models.enums.FeatureFlag` and a
:class:`FeatureFlagSpec` here. Mark ``established=True`` only for a feature that
is *already in live use* when you gate it — the migration backfills such flags
as available+enabled for existing tenants so gating them does not make them
vanish. New/unreleased features leave it False and ship dark.

    """Refuse to run a service method unless ``flag`` is live for this tenant.

    The service-layer half of feature gating. Entry surfaces (page decorator,
    ``require_feature`` on routers, admin-tab conditions) *hide* a disabled
    feature; this makes the owning service *refuse* it, so a caller that has no
    gate — a newly added page, a Discord interaction handler, a worker, a REST
    router someone forgot to mount behind ``require_feature`` — cannot reach
    functionality the community has not enabled. Both halves are required; see
    docs/features/feature-flags.md.

    Raises :class:`~application.errors.FeatureDisabledError` (a ``NotFoundError``,
    so REST answers 404 and UI ``except ValueError`` shows a notification).

    Placement: the service's **public entry methods** — every mutation, plus the
    top-level reads that return the feature's data. Not internal helpers, and
    never inside a transaction; the check is an authorization-style gate at the
    service boundary, and it reads a per-request cache so repeated guards in one
    request cost a single pass.

    Tolerates no tenant in scope by raising, like every other gate: a flag is
    never live without a tenant.
