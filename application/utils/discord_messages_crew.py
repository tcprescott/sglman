"""Discord Message Templates: match crew

The DM copy for :mod:`application.services.crew_service` and the ephemeral
replies the crew buttons send back — assignment, withdrawal, and the two
confirmations ``discordbot/crew_acknowledgment.py`` and
``discordbot/crew_signup.py`` reply with.

A sibling of :mod:`application.utils.discord_messages` rather than more lines in
it, on the same rule the qualifier and reschedule copy already follow: crew is a
domain of its own, and the parent module holds the match lifecycle. The
convention is otherwise identical — all Discord text lives in a builder, and
none of it is inlined in service or handler code.

Times arrive as **display strings** already rendered by
``discord_embeds.time_field``, so each recipient's client localises them.
