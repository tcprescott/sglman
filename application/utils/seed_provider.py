"""One execution envelope for every outbound seed-provider call.

Randomizer upstreams are third-party services with no availability promise, and a
seed roll is the most time-critical thing this app does — a race is scheduled,
the players are waiting, and the roll happens minutes before. Before this module
each generator in :mod:`application.services.seedgen_service` opened its own
client with its own error handling, no timeout, and no retry: a hung upstream
held the request open indefinitely, and a transient 502 was a hard failure where
one retry would have succeeded.

Every provider call now runs through :func:`call_provider`, which enforces:

* a **per-attempt timeout** (:data:`PROVIDER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`),
* **bounded retries with backoff** for the failures a retry can fix — timeouts,
  connection errors, 429 and 5xx — and none for the failures it cannot: a 4xx,
  a malformed payload, a missing credential,
* a **normalized exception taxonomy** carrying the provider's own message, so the
  caller can tell "alttpr.com is down, try again" from "this preset will never
  roll",
* **measurement** (attempts, latency) returned alongside the value, so the seed's
  provenance record does not need a second clock.

Every exception here subclasses ``ValueError``, which is what makes the taxonomy
usable without touching a single caller's error handling: the UI's
``except ValueError`` → ``ui.notify`` convention and the REST 400 mapping already
do the right thing with them.

A utility rather than a service: it enforces no business rule and reaches no
repository, so ``seedgen_service`` can import it without a cycle.
