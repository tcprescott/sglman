"""Recognising a ``ui.timer`` that outlived the page which created it.

``Timer._run_in_loop`` waits for the client to connect and only *then* enters
``self.parent_slot`` — while its own ``_should_stop`` (which does check
``is_deleted``) is evaluated **inside** that context. A page closed during that
wait leaves a dead slot behind, so the timer raises out of the ``with`` instead
of stopping quietly. Every board carrying the 5s roll-label tick
(``theme/tables/match.py``) that is closed before its socket settles lands in it.

Nobody can act on the result: the page is gone, there is no UI left to notify,
and the timer stops either way. Reported, it buried real errors in Sentry and
made ``scripts/ui_flag_sweep.sh`` fail for merely visiting pages — which cost a
full stash-and-rerun against ``main`` to establish it was pre-existing rather
than a regression.

``theme.timer_teardown.PageTimer`` closes the gap for our own timers. This
predicate is the backstop for any timer that doesn't use it, on every path the
race can surface: the app's ``on_exception`` handler (``frontend.py``); NiceGUI's
own default handler, which is ``log.exception`` on the ``nicegui`` logger and
runs alongside ours (``TimerTeardownLogFilter`` — Sentry's logging hook sits
behind logger filters, so this also keeps it out of Sentry); and Sentry's
``before_send`` (``application/utils/sentry.py``) for any other integration.

Pure stdlib, so the Sentry setup can use it without importing the UI layer.
