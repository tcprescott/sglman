"""
Timezone Utilities

All datetimes are stored in UTC. Which wall clock a human reads them on is a
presentation choice that varies per viewer, so every function here takes an
optional ``tz`` and otherwise resolves the ambient display zone from
``application/timezone_context.py``.

Two rules keep this honest:

- **Never store a localized datetime.** :func:`parse_local_datetime` is the only
  wall-clock → UTC ingress; it returns UTC-aware.
- **Never render a raw UTC one.** The ``format_local_*`` builders are the only
  UTC → human egress.

``tz=None`` (the default) means "the current viewer's zone". Pass an explicit
``tz`` whenever the output is *not* for the current request's viewer — a shared
or cached artifact, or a notification rendered for someone else. See
``docs/timezone-handling.md``.
