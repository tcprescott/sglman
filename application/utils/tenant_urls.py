"""Pure helpers for building and validating tenant-qualified URL paths.

Path-mode addressing prefixes every tenant route with ``/t/<slug>`` (surfaced to
request handlers as ``root_path``). These helpers keep post-login / OAuth return
targets inside the originating tenant so a shared-cookie login can't bounce a
user into a *different* community whose stale referrer is still in the session.

Pure (no NiceGUI / session / DB) so they unit-test in isolation; the presentation
layer reads the pending referrer from ``app.storage.user`` and passes it in.
