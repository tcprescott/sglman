"""Human-readable names for a match, for user-facing web copy.

The Discord side already refuses to print primary keys — see the module
docstring of :mod:`application.utils.discord_messages`, which states the rule
and identifies a match by its players, its time and its stage. The web copy was
the only place still talking in database ids ("sign up as a commentator for
match ID 17"), so the same identification lives here, built from the row the
surface already has rather than from a fresh query.

Pure formatting: takes strings and dicts, touches no ORM, so both the
presentation layer and the services can use it.
