"""Parsing ids out of public URLs.

A spectator link pasted with a trailing character or an extra digit is the input
the public routes see most. Typed as ``int`` in the route signature, the first
kind answers FastAPI's raw 422 JSON, and the second reaches Postgres as a value
an ``INT`` column cannot hold and comes back as a 500 (plus a Sentry event per
bad link). Both are just "no such page", so these routes take the segment as a
string and parse it here.

Pure, so it unit-tests without a request.
