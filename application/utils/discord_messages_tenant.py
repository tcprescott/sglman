"""Discord Message Templates: community membership

The DM copy for :mod:`application.services.tenant_membership_service` — the ask
that reaches a community's staff, and the answer that goes back to whoever
asked.

A sibling of :mod:`application.utils.discord_messages` rather than more lines in
it, on the same rule the qualifier and reschedule copy already follow: joining a
community is a domain of its own, and the parent module holds the match
lifecycle. The convention is otherwise identical — all Discord text lives in a
builder, and none of it is inlined in service or handler code.
