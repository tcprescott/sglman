"""In-process pub/sub that keeps open check-in desks in step with each other.

The check-in counterpart of :mod:`application.events.match_live`: services
publish after committing a roster change, and ``theme/realtime.py`` subscribes
each open desk page so a check-in made on one phone shows on every other phone
working the same event. No NiceGUI import, so the service layer can publish.

Subscribers are plain callables ``(event_id, entrant_id, change_type) -> None``
that must only *schedule* work. ``entrant_id`` is ``None`` for ``ROSTER``, the
one signal a sync sends instead of one per row. ``publish`` swallows each
subscriber's exceptions so one bad desk cannot break the mutating call.

This is for UI refresh only. Domain events go on ``event_bus``.
