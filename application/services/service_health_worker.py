"""Platform service-health monitor worker (PR 5).

A background loop (modeled on ``discord_event_worker``) that periodically refreshes
every dependency probe, keeping the ``/platform`` health board warm and driving the
alert-on-transition path without anyone loading the page. Gated by
``SERVICE_HEALTH_ENABLED`` (off by default); the board still refreshes on demand
from the UI regardless.

Runs with **no tenant scope** — every probe is platform-level (the racetime and
Challonge probes read across all tenants via explicitly-unscoped queries). The loop
never dies: a failing tick is logged and retried next interval.
