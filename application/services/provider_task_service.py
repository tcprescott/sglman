"""Lifecycle of :class:`ProviderTask` — long-running upstream provider calls.

Owns the row and its state transitions; knows nothing about what any particular
task *is*. What to do when one finishes belongs to the module that queued it
(today ``seed_roll_service`` for ``operation='generate_seed'``), which the
worker dispatches to.

The split matters because the two halves have different reasons to change: how a
task is claimed, timed out, and swept is queue mechanics, while what a finished
task means is domain work with its own audit trail and notifications.
