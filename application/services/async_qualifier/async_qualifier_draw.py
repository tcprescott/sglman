"""Async qualifier — draw & scoring engine.

The imbalance-forcing permalink draw and the par/score recompute lifted out of
:class:`AsyncQualifierService`. Holds the repositories it needs, composed by the
service the same way :class:`MatchService` composes ``MatchScheduleService``. It
performs no audit writes and publishes no events — those stay with the service
methods that call it.
