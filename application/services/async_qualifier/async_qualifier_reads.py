"""Async qualifier — the player's read surface and the leaderboard.

Everything a competitor's own pages ask for: which qualifiers are open, what this
one looks like from outside the admin gate, whether they can start a run (and if
not, why not), their own runs, their reattempt allowance, and the board.

Mixed into :class:`AsyncQualifierService` — the same composition
``application/services/_bracket/`` uses — so the orchestration module stays inside
the file-length guideline. Reads only: nothing here writes or audits.
