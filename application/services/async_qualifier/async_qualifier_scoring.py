"""Async-qualifier par + score + leaderboard math (PR 9).

Pure, DB-free functions ported from SahasrahBot's async-tournament scoring so the
formulas are unit-testable in isolation; :class:`AsyncQualifierService` assembles
the inputs from repositories and applies the results.

- **par** = mean of the ``sample_size`` fastest *finished + approved* runs on a
  permalink (whole seconds).
- **score** = ``clamp(0, 105, (2 - elapsed/par) * 100)`` — 100 at par, 0 at twice
  par, capped at 105 for a run ~5% under par.
- **leaderboard** = per-pool ``runs_per_pool`` slots; a user's best scores fill
  their slots, unfilled slots count 0 (``actual``); a separate ``estimate``
  projects the user's mean realized-slot score across all slots (finished runs
  only, so a partial entrant isn't understated). No tie-break — Python's stable
  sort preserves the provided (deterministic) input order.
