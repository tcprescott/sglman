"""
Accommodation Service - Business Logic Layer

ADA accommodation requests: a member ticks a box on their profile (with
optional details), and the community's STAFF track each request through
``NEW → ACKNOWLEDGED → ARRANGED`` with their own private notes.

Who sees what is the whole design. The requester sees their own checkbox,
details and status, never the staff notes. STAFF (and super-admins, via
``AuthService.is_staff``) see everything for their community. PROCTORs learn
only that an Arranged request exists (the icon on their match boards), never the
text. Nobody else sees anything, and no free text leaves the app: audit rows
carry ids and status only, nothing is published on the event bus, the staff DMs
name the member and nothing more, and there is no REST or MCP surface.
