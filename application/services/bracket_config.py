"""Bracket config substrate — the schema-validated shape of ``Bracket.config``.

Native brackets keep their per-stage knobs — grand-final reset toggle, Swiss
round count, group count, the scoring points a round robin / Swiss standings pass
consumes, and the tiebreaker order — as a closed, ``extra='forbid'`` JSON blob so
a typo or a stale client field surfaces as a user-facing ``ValueError`` instead
of silently landing dead data. This module owns that schema; the service layer
calls :func:`validate_bracket_config` before persisting the blob.

Advancement config (how a later stage draws from a prior stage's final ranks) is
added by a later unit — this schema deliberately leaves room for it rather than
implementing it now.
