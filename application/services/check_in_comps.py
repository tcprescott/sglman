"""Complimentary badges for event check-in.

An event's comp rules say who gets in without buying a badge: holders of the
roles in ``CheckInEvent.comp_roles``, and, with ``comp_volunteers`` on,
volunteers whose published shifts in the event window reach the community's
lowest volunteer comp tier (``SystemConfigService.get_volunteer_comp_tiers``,
8 hours for SGL). The hours are *scheduled*: at check-in most shifts haven't
happened yet, and it is the same total the volunteer roster shows.

:meth:`CheckInService.sync_event` works out who is comped once per sync
(:func:`comped_users`), lets the badge sync treat a comped buyer as holding a
badge, then :func:`apply_comps` reconciles the roster: the comp reasons on every
row, a ``COMP`` row for each comped person not already on it, and withdrawal of
a ``COMP`` row whose person stopped qualifying.
