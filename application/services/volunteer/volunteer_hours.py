"""
Volunteer Hours Service - Business Logic Layer

Totals the time a volunteer actually served, against the per-tenant comp tiers
(``KEY_VOLUNTEER_COMP_TIERS``). SGL comps a badge at 8 hours with more at 12 and
16; before this the coordinator added the hours up by eye from a spreadsheet.

This module only reads. There is no ``AuditActions`` entry and no ``EventType``
here on purpose — nothing is written, so there is nothing to audit or publish.
