"""Station Service - Business Logic Layer

CRUD for the venue's station pool. Staff-only; the pool is community
configuration, not per-match data.

A community with no stations keeps the historical free-text station behaviour —
``MatchService.assign_stations`` only validates against the pool once it exists.
That is what lets this ship without a per-tenant feature flag.
