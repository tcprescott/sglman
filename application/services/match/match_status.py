"""One derived status vocabulary shared by the schedule, the bracket, and Discord.

Before this module there were three: ``Match`` had no enum at all (five nullable
timestamps read newest-first, in two places), ``BracketMatch`` had
:class:`~models.BracketMatchState`, and ``BracketMatchGame`` had
:class:`~models.BracketMatchGameState`. Each surface showed whichever it happened
to hold, so a bracket card said "Scheduled" for a match the schedule was calling
"In Progress".

:class:`MatchStatus` is the single vocabulary all three project into. It is
**derived, never stored** (docs/plans/bracket-match-integration-plan.md, D5): the
timestamps stay the source of truth and this module is a pure projection of them.

Pure and ORM-free, like its peers ``match_source_guard`` / ``match_request_guard``
— no queries, no NiceGUI — so services, the REST API, the Discord builders, and
the presentation layer can all call it on data they already hold.
