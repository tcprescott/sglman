"""Which physical station each player sits at, and what is already taken.

Split out of ``match_service`` the way :class:`MatchReviewMixin` and
:class:`CancellationMixin` are: ``StationAssignmentMixin`` is composed into
:class:`MatchService` and reaches ``_require_match``, ``repository``,
``station_repository`` and ``audit_service`` through that composed class.

The validation here is the interesting part. A station has to match the
community's configured format, be one it has actually defined, and not already
be occupied by a match in play — and the assignment's *keys* have to be this
match's player-row ids, because the near-miss is a user id and applying the
subset that happens to match would report success for a write that changed
nothing.
