"""Pre-match stage reminder loop.

A runner told hours ago that they're on Kraid has played two matches since. This
worker sends one more DM shortly before the match, naming the stage and the
time, to the players and approved crew of every match that has one.

Modelled on ``application/services/volunteer/volunteer_reminder.py``, which
solves the same problem for a shift: a cross-tenant scan over a generous fixed
window, then a per-row re-check against that row's own configured lead. The lead
here is per *tournament* (``Tournament.stage_reminder_minutes``) rather than per
tenant, because a Best-of-NES stage call and an OOTR stage call are not the same
problem.

Publishes no event. The reminder observes a match nobody changed, so there is no
fact to record beyond the stamp itself.
