"""Player-initiated match creation, split out of ``match_service``.

Pure code motion to keep ``match_service`` under the file-length guideline —
``MatchRequestMixin`` is composed into :class:`MatchService` and reaches its
repositories, ``participants``, and ``_seed_acknowledgments`` through that
composed class, the same way :class:`CancellationMixin` does.
