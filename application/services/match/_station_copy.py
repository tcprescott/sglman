"""Naming the match sitting at an occupied station.

Both places a proctor meets a station conflict — the picker option ("Station 4 —
in use (…)") and the refusal ``assign_stations`` raises — used to quote a primary
key. That is the one thing a proctor standing in the venue cannot act on: their
next move is to go and find the people at that station, so the copy says who they
are. The rule is ``application.utils.match_labels``'; this module is the read
that feeds it.

Lives beside :mod:`match_service` rather than inside it because it is the same
kind of thing as ``_dm_context`` — the wording of one interaction, resolved from
the rows a repository can supply. Business-layer, so it may call a repository;
``match_labels`` itself stays pure formatting and cannot.
