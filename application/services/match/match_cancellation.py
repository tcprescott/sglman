"""Match cancellation — calling a scheduled match off, and telling people.

Lifted out of :class:`MatchService` (the file-length guideline) as
``MatchParticipants`` was, but as a **mixin** rather than a helper object,
because these methods reach the service's ``_remove_match``, ``audit_service``,
and ``match_schedule_service`` — the same composition ``BracketService`` uses for
``application/services/_bracket/``.

Cancellation is deliberately distinct from deletion. ``delete_match`` is the
staff "this shouldn't exist" path and notifies nobody; cancelling is "this was
real, people committed to it, and it is now off" — so it closes the racetime
room, DMs the players and crew, and emits ``match.cancelled`` alongside the
``match.deleted`` every existing subscriber already listens for.
