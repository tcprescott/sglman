"""A player confirming they have seen the match they are scheduled for.

Split out of ``match_service`` the way :class:`MatchReviewMixin` and
:class:`CancellationMixin` are: :class:`MatchAcknowledgmentMixin` is composed
into :class:`MatchService` and reaches ``_require_match``, ``repository``,
``ack_repository``, ``participants`` and ``audit_service`` through that composed
class.

Only a current player of the match may acknowledge, and only once — the second
attempt is a refusal rather than a no-op, because the button that sent it is
telling its clicker something happened. The seeding path is the other half: a
match is scheduled with a row per player already there, so the board can show
who has not answered rather than an empty column.
