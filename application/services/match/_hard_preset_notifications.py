"""DMs for the hard-preset opt-in.

Three messages, each sent to a whole match at once:

* **invited** — the offer, when the match is scheduled. The only DM in the app
  whose button differs per recipient, so that it can carry each player's own
  next move without reporting anyone else's.
* **agreed / broken** — the moment everyone has opted in, and the moment a
  complete set breaks. Nothing is sent for an individual opt-in, because the
  feature turns on nobody hearing about those.
* **overridden** — staff choosing the match's settings themselves.

Free functions rather than a notifier class: each is a single fan-out with no
shared state, and they are enqueued on ``discord_queue`` from
``MatchHardPresetService``. Everything they need is passed in, because the queue
worker awaits them outside the enqueuing request's tenant scope.
