"""SpeedGaming read-only guard for ``MatchService.update_match`` (PR 7).

The per-field half of the hybrid read-only contract: a ``Match`` materialized
from an SG episode has ETL-owned fields (schedule, players, tournament) that only
the next sync may change. Extracted into its own module to keep ``match_service``
focused (and under the file-length guideline). Comparison is by *value* so the
edit dialog can resubmit the disabled fields unchanged; only a genuine change is
rejected. The UI also disables these fields, but this is the enforcement — a gap
here would be silently reverted on the next sync and look like a bug.
