"""Pick seats for a match's two players — opposite sides of the room, at random.

The counterpart to :class:`StationAssignmentMixin`: that one *validates and
writes* a seating a proctor chose, this one *proposes* one. Composed into
:class:`MatchService` the same way, and it reaches ``_require_match``,
``repository`` and ``station_repository`` through that composed class.

Nothing here writes. The suggestion goes back to the check-in dialog, which
fills its pickers with it and lets the proctor override before submitting —
so the only path that touches ``MatchPlayers.assigned_station`` is still
``assign_stations``, with its existing validation, audit and event.

Two rules, in priority order:

1. **Opposite sides.** The two players do not sit in the same half of the room.
   Enforced by drawing each player from a different :class:`StationSide`.
2. **Spread out.** Within a side, prefer a station whose neighbours are empty.
   Neighbours are same side, same section, ``position`` one apart.

Both bend rather than break. A full room, a one-sided pool, or a venue that has
described no layout at all still gets a valid random seating; each rule that
could not be honoured comes back named in ``relaxations`` so the dialog can say
so instead of quietly seating two players elbow to elbow.
