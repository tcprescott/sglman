Match Display Service - Read/Formatting Layer

View-model assembly for the match tables: reads matches (and their
acknowledgments) via repositories and formats them into the plain dicts the
NiceGUI table slots consume. Extracted from ``MatchService`` so the latter
keeps only lifecycle logic.

Read-only: no writes, no audit, no Discord notifications.
