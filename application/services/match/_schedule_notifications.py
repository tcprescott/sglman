"""Match notification mixin: the Discord DM / embed fan-out for a match.

Split out of ``match_schedule_service.py`` as pure code motion — that module had
grown past the 800-line budget after absorbing the bracket integration. Follows
the ``_bracket/`` mixin convention: ``MatchNotificationMixin`` is composed into
:class:`MatchScheduleService`, and its methods reach ``self.discord_service`` /
``self.acknowledgment_repository`` and sibling notify methods through that one
composed class, so every caller keeps using ``MatchScheduleService`` unchanged.

Every public method here is best-effort: a DM failure is logged and swallowed so
it can never block the lifecycle operation that triggered it.
