"""The match lookups every entry surface goes through.

Split out of ``match_service`` the way :class:`MatchReviewMixin` and
:class:`CancellationMixin` are: :class:`MatchReadsMixin` is composed into
:class:`MatchService` and reaches ``repository`` through that composed class.
Reads only — nothing here writes, audits or notifies.

They live on the service rather than being left to callers because
``pages/``, ``api/`` and ``discordbot/`` must never reach through
``match_service.repository`` for a simple read (``enforce_architecture.py``
blocks it), and because two of them are not pass-throughs at all: which
instants make up "that day" is a rule about the display clock, and grouping by
stage is the shape the board wants rather than the shape the table has.
