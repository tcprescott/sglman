"""Players privately agreeing to play a match on the tournament's harder preset.

A tournament may name a second, harder preset beside its standard one. Each
player in a match can opt in to it. The match rolls the harder preset only when
**every** player has opted in, and until that happens no player can learn
whether anyone else did.

That secrecy is the feature, not a detail of it. If one player could see the
other's pending opt-in, opting in would become a challenge to answer and
declining would become a refusal to meet it — and the reason to offer harder
settings at all is that two people both want them, not that one of them dared
the other. So a lone opt-in is silent: it notifies nobody, publishes no event,
and appears on no surface but the opter's own. It simply lapses when the seed
rolls.

**What the secrecy does and does not promise.** A player who has not opted in
learns nothing at all — that is the property the feature rests on, and the one
that stops opting in from becoming a dare. A player who *has* opted in does
learn the outcome: agreement is announced, and its absence is itself
informative, so they can conclude their opponent is not in. That much is
unavoidable, since a player who commits has to find out what they are playing.
It also means a player willing to opt in and immediately withdraw can probe the
other's answer, and the withdrawal is invisible. Closing that would mean adding
friction to withdrawal, which the product deliberately does not have: the window
stays open until the seed rolls. Treat "nobody learns anything" as true only for
the player who has not committed.

Three things follow, and each is load-bearing:

* :meth:`my_state` is the only read any surface may call, and it answers about
  the caller alone. ``everyone_in`` can be true only when the caller is one of
  the everyone — a caller who has not opted in cannot make the set complete, so
  the flag never leaks a state the caller is not already part of.
* The individual opt-in is audited but **not** published on the event bus.
  Webhook subscribers are arbitrary outside listeners; the audit log is staff
  reading their own community's history, which the user accepted.
* Agreement is derived (opt-in set == player set), never stored. A roster change
  re-answers the question instead of leaving a stale yes behind.

Staff can overrule the whole thing per match with ``Match.preset_override``,
in either direction. That is deliberately visible: it is staff's decision about
the match, and the players are told. It still reveals nothing, because forcing
the hard preset says nothing about who had opted in.

Both opting in and withdrawing are refused once the seed is rolled. From that
point ``GeneratedSeeds.preset`` is the record of what was actually played, and a
choice about settings that are already decided is not a choice.
