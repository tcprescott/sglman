"""The dispute signal: a proctor flags a recorded result, an admin resolves it.

Deliberately **just a flag**, not a workflow. There is no review state, no
assignment, no thread, and no note — the proctor raising it is standing in the
room, and writing up what happened is a conversation, not a textarea to fill in
between matches. The match stays ``Finished`` and confirming it *is* the
resolution (see ``MatchScheduleService.confirm_match``). ``clear_review`` is
the escape hatch for "looked at it, nothing to fix, not confirming yet".

Split out of ``match_service`` the way :class:`MatchRequestMixin` and
:class:`CancellationMixin` are: ``MatchReviewMixin`` is composed into
:class:`MatchService` and reaches ``_require_match`` and ``audit_service``
through that composed class.
