"""Players offering their own match for stream.

A signal, not a request queue. A player says "we're happy to be on stream" and
staff see it while they build the stream schedule — that is the whole feature.
It deliberately does **not** set ``Match.is_stream_candidate``: deciding what
goes out is ``can_assign_match_stream``'s job, and a player's offer must not be
able to write the decision it is asking about. Every surface that shows a
volunteer says so, because a control that looks like it books a stream slot and
does not is worse than no control.

Only the match's own players may volunteer it, and only before it starts —
after that there is nothing left for staff to schedule.
