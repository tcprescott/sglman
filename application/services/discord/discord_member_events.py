"""What the bot does with ``GUILD_MEMBER_*`` gateway events.

Two independent syncs hang off the same events — application roles (from the
member's Discord roles, provisioning an account for a mapped-role holder who
has none) and the cached avatar hash — so they live together here
rather than in :mod:`discord_service`, which owns the bot singleton and the DM
senders. ``get_discord_bot`` wires both listeners; nothing else calls them.

Both are best-effort by design: they log and swallow, because an exception
escaping a gateway listener takes the connection down with it. Services are
imported lazily inside each function to avoid a circular import back through
:mod:`discord_service`.
