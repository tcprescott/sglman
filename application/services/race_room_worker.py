"""Auto-open worker for scheduled racetime rooms (PR 6).

A lightweight background loop (modeled on ``volunteer_reminder``) that opens a
racetime room ahead of each eligible scheduled match. Opt-in per tournament
(``racetime_auto_create_rooms`` + ``room_open_minutes_before``); a match is
eligible only when **all** its entrants have a linked racetime identity. The
worker is idempotent (one ``RacetimeRoom`` per match — creation returns the
existing room), tenant-safe (each match's work runs inside ``tenant_scope``), and
crash-resilient (a per-match failure is logged and retried next tick).

Rescheduling a match with an already-open room keeps the room — the worker never
creates a second one, and it does not touch an existing room's time.
