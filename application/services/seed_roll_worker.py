"""Background poller for seed rolls that live on a :class:`ProviderTask`.

The only thing that advances a task-queue roll. A request submits and returns;
this loop checks every unfinished task, completes the ones that landed, and
retires the ones that never will.

Because it reads its work from the table rather than from memory, restarting
mid-roll costs nothing but the seconds until the next tick — the resumed poll is
the same code as the first one, not a recovery path that only runs after a
crash and therefore only breaks after a crash.
