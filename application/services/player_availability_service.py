Player Availability Service - Business Logic Layer

Self-service availability for any logged-in player. Unlike volunteer availability,
this has no role or opt-in gate — any authenticated user may say when they cannot play.

**Player availability is opt-out.** A player who has said nothing is available for
the whole event; the windows they save are the times they *cannot* play (plus, as
a bonus signal, the times they would prefer). This is the one place the two
availability subsystems differ in meaning: volunteer windows are opt-in, so a
volunteer who has said nothing is not offered a shift. Everything unspecified
resolves through the ``default=AVAILABLE`` argument to
:mod:`application.services.availability_windows`.
