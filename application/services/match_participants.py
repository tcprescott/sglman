"""Match participant orchestration — roster & acknowledgment row syncing.

Pure repository orchestration lifted out of :class:`MatchService` so that module
stays focused on business rules, audit, and events. This helper owns the "who is
in the match" bookkeeping: resolving user ids, enrolling players in the
tournament, syncing the player and crew rows to a target set, and (re)seeding the
per-player acknowledgment rows. It performs no audit writes and publishes no
events — those stay with the service methods that call it.
