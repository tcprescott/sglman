"""Discord Link Service — verified tenant ↔ Discord-server connection.

Links a tenant to a Discord guild only when the acting user proves they
administer that guild. The proof is Discord's own bot-authorization flow — which
only a member with *Manage Server* can complete — followed by a server-side
re-check that the acting user (not merely *someone* who clicked through consent)
has Manage Server / Administrator / is the owner of the guild Discord bound the
bot to. No client-supplied guild id is ever trusted.

Runs on the platform surface as well as inside a tenant, so it takes the target
``Tenant`` explicitly and does its own STAFF/super-admin gate rather than relying
on the ambient tenant for authorization.
