"""Matcherino check-in sync worker.

Polls each open :class:`~models.CheckInEvent` that has a venue, on that event's
own ``sync_interval_minutes``, so the desk's roster keeps up with late
registrations without anyone pressing Sync. Each event's work runs inside its
tenant's ``tenant_scope`` as the reserved system ``User``, and skips tenants
that have check-in turned off.

Ungated by an environment switch, like the async-qualifier worker: it only ever
touches events staff have opened, and a deployment with none has nothing for it
to find. A failing sync (Matcherino down, its shape changed) is recorded on the
event by the service and retried next tick; it never stops the other events.
