"""Discord Scheduled Events reconciler worker (PR 8).

A background loop (modeled on ``speedgaming_sync_worker`` / ``race_room_worker``)
that periodically reconciles every tenant with a linked Discord guild: its
opted-in tournaments' scheduled matches are mirrored into that guild's Discord
Scheduled Events. Gated by ``DISCORD_EVENTS_SYNC_ENABLED`` (off by default). Each
tenant's reconcile runs inside ``tenant_scope`` acting as the reserved **system
``User``**, so audit/event attribution and the shared-guild safety scoping are
correct even though the loop runs off a timer with no request context.

Per-tenant failures are logged and retried next tick — one bad guild never stops
the others, and the loop itself never dies. Reconciliation is idempotent, so a
tenant whose schedule hasn't changed is a cheap no-op (content hashes match, no
Discord calls).
