"""Race Room Service — the racetime room lifecycle for scheduled matches (PR 6).

The business layer that both the auto-open worker and the ``racetimebot/``
handlers call. It maps the racetime room lifecycle onto a :class:`~models.Match`:

    create → open (+ attach seed) → in-progress → finish (capture results) → …
                                                 ↘ cancel

Every transition audits and publishes a ``race_room.*`` domain event, and the
service **acts as the system user** (the racetime room, not a human, is driving
the change). Result capture maps racetime entrants back to linked ``User`` rows,
records place (``finish_rank``) + elapsed time (``finish_time``), handles the
terminal states (forfeit / no-show / DQ / one-finisher), and feeds the existing
result-reporting path (Challonge push is an optional downstream step — a
non-Challonge tournament still closes).

Tenant-scoped: callers run inside ``tenant_scope`` (the worker binds
``match.tenant_id``; the handler binds ``room.tenant_id``; the manual-create UI
runs in the request's tenant). ``manual_create_room`` is the one method gated by
an interactive permission (STAFF / ``SYNC_ADMIN``); the rest are system paths.

A room is real before it is recorded: :meth:`create_room_for_match` asks
racetime.gg to open it (the category bot's ``startrace``, with the tournament's
``RaceRoomProfile``), stores the slug racetime returns, and only then writes the
row as OPEN and tells the players. A refused ``startrace`` leaves nothing behind.

        Peer of :meth:`_push_challonge`, and necessary for the same reason it
        exists: a racetime finish stamps ``finished_at`` but never *confirms* the
        match, and ``advance_if_linked`` hangs off ``confirm_match``, whose only
        callers are human. Without this a best-of series on an auto-room
        tournament would sit un-clinched — and its unneeded games un-cancelled —
        until someone clicked Confirm on every game.

        Settling is a compare-and-swap on the game row, so a later human confirm
        is a no-op rather than a double count.
