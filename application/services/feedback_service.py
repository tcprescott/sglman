"""
Feedback Service - Business Logic Layer

Records in-app feedback from logged-in attendees, lets staff review it, and lets
the person who sent it see what happened to it.

That last part is the loop closing. For a long time the only thing staff could
do was **Mark reviewed**: it was one-way, and the submitter — who might have
asked an actual question through the form — had no way to learn anything had
happened at all. Review is reversible now (a mis-click is a mis-click), and a
person's own submissions carry their status on their profile.

Gated by :attr:`~models.FeatureFlag.FEEDBACK`: a community can turn the whole
subsystem off, and when they do the service refuses it rather than relying on
the sidebar entry being hidden.
