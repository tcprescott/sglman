"""Tenant Setup Service - Business Logic Layer

Whether a community has what it needs to run, derived on every read.

Nothing here is stored: a tenant that deletes its last tournament becomes
un-set-up again, and the checklist says so. Storing progress would invent a
second source of truth that drifts the first time someone deletes a tournament.

Read-only — it takes no ``actor`` and writes no audit row.
