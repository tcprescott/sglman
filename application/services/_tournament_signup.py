"""Tournament signup — the player's own way in, and out.

Signing up used to be a checkbox on the Profile tab with no window, no
membership check and no event: the UI listed every active tournament in the
tenant and enrolled whoever ticked a box. Everything that makes it a real
opt-in lives here — the window check, the membership gate, the Challonge
carve-out, and the audit-plus-event pair every enrolment change shares,
whoever made it.

Mixed into :class:`~application.services.tournament_service.TournamentService`
— the same composition ``application/services/_bracket/`` and the async
qualifier use — so the orchestration module stays inside the file-length
guideline.
