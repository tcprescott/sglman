"""Double-elimination engine — emits the whole winners+losers graph up front.

Pure structural code: no ORM, no NiceGUI, no async. ``generate`` maps a seeded
field onto ``GeneratedMatch`` nodes wired by ``winner_to`` / ``loser_to``
pointers: a standard winners bracket (positive rounds), a losers bracket
(negative rounds) that receives each winners round's losers, a grand final, and
a conditional grand-final reset (docs/brackets-plan.md).

Losers-bracket routing follows the standard halving pattern (WB-R1 losers pair,
then alternating drop-receiving and consolidation rounds down to a single losers
final). Positional feeding is used; perfect WB-rematch avoidance is not attempted.

Structure ported in spirit from the MIT-licensed ``smwa/python-tournaments``
``double_elimination`` package; our ``GeneratedMatch`` contract is authoritative.
