"""Shared standings & tiebreakers — pure functions over opaque entrant refs.

Round robin uses this now; Swiss and stage-completion ranking will consume the
same API to write each entry's ``final_rank`` (docs/brackets-plan.md). There is
no ORM here: entrants are plain ``int`` refs (the service passes ``BracketEntry``
ids) and results are plain :class:`ResultRow` records. The module computes match
points and a configurable chain of tiebreakers, then assigns 1-based competition
ranks, leaving genuinely-unresolved ties sharing a rank and pointing at each
other via :attr:`Standing.tied_with` (the service surfaces those for a staff
override).

Tiebreakers (config-selectable, applied in the listed order until a tie breaks):

* ``buchholz`` — strength of schedule: the sum of each played opponent's total
  match points (byes contribute no opponent).
* ``omw`` — opponent match-win percentage (MTG's OMW%): the average, over
  opponents actually played, of each opponent's ``wins / matches_played``, with
  each opponent's percentage floored at :attr:`StandingsConfig.omw_floor`. Byes
  count as a win and a played match when computing an opponent's percentage, but
  a bye is not itself an opponent and is excluded from the average.
* ``head_to_head`` — evaluated *within a tied group only*: order by the number of
  wins each tied member has against the rest of the tied set. Decisive only when
  those internal results yield distinct win counts; a cycle (everyone 1-1) leaves
  the group tied.
