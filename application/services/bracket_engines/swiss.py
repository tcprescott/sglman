"""Swiss pairing engine — one round at a time from live standings.

Pure structural code: no ORM, no NiceGUI, no async. This module is only a thin
*adapter* over the ``swisspair`` library (MIT), which does the actual work: it
builds the score-group weighted graph and runs the min-cost perfect matching
that yields no-rematch, minimal-score-difference pairings plus a single
lowest-standing bye. Here we translate ``PairingPlayer`` state into
``swisspair.Player`` inputs and map the returned matches back to ``ref`` tuples
(docs/brackets-plan.md).

Determinism note: when several matchings share the minimum cost (e.g. round one
with everyone on zero points), swisspair breaks the tie with an internal RNG, so
repeated calls return different — all legal — pairings. The ``pair_round``
contract requires determinism, so we encode each player's ``points`` as
``scaled_points * M + (N - rank)``: the high-order term keeps the score-group
structure (a half point still survives via the ``* 2`` scale), while the
low-order rank term is a deterministic tiebreak that makes the min-cost solution
unique. ``M`` is chosen far larger than any accumulated rank offset, so a real
score-group difference always outweighs the tiebreak — swisspair still pairs
within score groups; it just resolves in-group ties by adjacent rank.
