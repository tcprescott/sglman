"""Single-elimination engine — emits the whole winners-bracket graph up front.

Pure structural code: no ORM, no NiceGUI, no async. ``generate`` maps a seeded
field onto ``GeneratedMatch`` nodes wired by ``winner_to`` pointers, with byes
placed structurally so higher seeds meet lower ones (docs/brackets-plan.md).
