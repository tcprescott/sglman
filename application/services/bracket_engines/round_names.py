"""Round naming — "Semifinals", "Losers Round 2", "Grand Finals (Reset)".

Pure and ORM-free, alongside :mod:`standings` (the established home for bracket
logic shared beyond one caller). This lived in ``theme/brackets/layout.py``,
which meant **only the rendered bracket could name a round** — a service, a
Discord DM, or a REST payload had a round *number* and no way to turn it into
the word a player uses. That is why the matchup-ready DM (U5) needs this module
before it can be written; ``layout.py`` now imports :func:`round_label` from here
and re-exports it, so the card layer is unchanged.

Naming needs three facts beyond the round number — which round is the winners
final, how deep the losers bracket runs, and which matches are the grand final
and its reset — and all three are structural. :func:`round_names` derives them
from the light :class:`RoundNode` projection of a stage's graph and returns the
whole ``{round_number: name}`` map in one pass.
