"""Bracket engine contract — pure structural types, no ORM (docs/brackets-plan.md).

An engine turns a seeded field + a validated config into a description of a
bracket's match graph. It never touches the database: it returns plain
dataclasses that :class:`~application.services.bracket_service.BracketService`
maps onto ``BracketEntry`` / ``BracketMatch`` rows and persists. There are two
engine shapes, both registered under the ``'bracket_format'`` strategy kind:

* **Generative** (single/double elimination, round robin) — ``generate()`` emits
  the *entire* match graph up front, with ``winner_to`` / ``loser_to`` pointers
  and seed placements. Elimination advancement afterwards is plain
  pointer-following over the persisted rows; the engine is never re-run.
* **Pairing** (Swiss) — ``pair_round()`` is a stateless per-round call: given the
  current standings and pairing history it returns the next round's pairings,
  which the service persists as new ``BracketMatch`` rows.

Seed indices are **1-based positions into the seeded entrant list** (seed 1 = top
seed). The engine speaks only in these indices and ``(round, position, slot)``
coordinates; the service owns the mapping to real entry ids.

Round convention: positive rounds are the winners bracket; **negative rounds are
the losers bracket** (start.gg's convention), used by double elimination.
