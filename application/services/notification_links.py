"""Where each notification's call to action goes.

Every DM that asks the recipient to *do* something gets a :class:`DMLink` from
here, which ``send_dm`` renders as a Discord link button and hands to the
web-push mirror as its tap target. One module rather than a private
``_url`` helper per service, because the same three mistakes kept recurring:

* a **relative** path, meaningless in a DM read outside any request context;
* a link to a page that merely *mentions* the thing, leaving the reader to find
  it — the ask has to land on the control that performs it;
* a link to a surface the recipient cannot act on. The matchup-ready DM pointed
  entrants at ``/brackets/<id>``, whose Schedule button is ``is_staff``-gated, so
  the one message in the app whose whole purpose is "go book this" ended at a
  dialog with a Close button. :func:`player_schedule` is that fix.

Every builder returns ``None`` when the tenant cannot be resolved. A DM without a
button is worse than no DM; a DM with a button pointing nowhere is worse than
both, and Discord rejects an empty link URL outright.

Service-layer, not ``utils``: resolving the tenant in scope needs
:class:`TenantService`. The *paths* stay pure in
:mod:`application.utils.app_links`, shared with the pages that render the same
routes.
