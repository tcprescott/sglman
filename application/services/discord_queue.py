"""Serial Discord-notification queue.

A single instance of the shared ``CoroutineQueue`` — the one chokepoint every
Discord notification flows through. ``enqueue`` puts a send coroutine on the
queue; the lone worker awaits them in order and logs (never swallows silently)
any failure so it reaches logs + Sentry.

    enqueuer's context — so any ``require_tenant_id()`` reached inside a notify
    coroutine (recipient fan-out, acknowledgment queries, …) would raise in the
    worker and be swallowed, dropping the DM. Capture the enqueuing request's
    tenant *now* (request context) and re-establish it around the coroutine when
    the worker awaits it. This is the ``volunteer_reminder._scoped_dm`` pattern
    applied once, at the queue chokepoint every notification flows through.

    Enqueued outside any tenant (rare — a genuinely tenant-agnostic send) the
