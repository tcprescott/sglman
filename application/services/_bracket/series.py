"""Best-of-N series: game numbering, standings, clinch, and the auto-open hold.

A bracket match spans ``best_of`` games and **every game is its own scheduled
``Match``** (:class:`~models.BracketMatchGame`). A best-of-1 is a series with one
game, so this mixin is on the path for every bracket match, not just long ones.

Two rules shape everything here:

* **The bracket match stays OPEN for the whole series** and completes only on the
  clinch, which delegates to :meth:`AdvancementMixin._record_result`. Every
  downstream behaviour — ``winner_to``/``loser_to`` pointer-following, the
  grand-final reset, walkover settling, stage completion — is therefore reused
  byte-for-byte rather than reimplemented per-game.
* **Settling a game is a compare-and-swap.** Two independent paths settle games:
  ``RaceRoomService.record_finish`` on the racetimebot's task, and
  ``advance_if_linked`` on the serial ``discord_queue``. Counting one game's win
  twice would let a Bo3 "clinch" 2-0 off a single game.

``SeriesMixin`` is composed into :class:`BracketService`; its methods reach
siblings, ``self.repository``, and ``self.audit_service`` through that class.
