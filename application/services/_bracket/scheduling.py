        The mirror of :meth:`advance_if_linked`, and the fix for the sharpest
        defect in the bracket↔schedule seam: ``BracketMatchGame.match`` is
        SET_NULL, so cancelling a best-of-1's ``Match`` used to leave a
        ``SCHEDULED`` game row whose ``game_number`` stayed consumed —
        ``_has_free_game_slot`` then reported the series fully booked and the
        matchup vanished from ``list_open_matches_for_user``, the player
        dashboard, and its own schedule dialog, permanently and silently.

        Three things shape it:

        1. **It must run before the row is deleted.** After ``_remove_match`` the
           SET_NULL has fired and the game is unreachable from the match — the
           same ordering constraint the cancellation DM fan-out documents.
        2. **Only a ``SCHEDULED`` game is released.** A ``COMPLETE`` game keeps
           its result *and* its consumed slot: the bracket has already advanced
           on it, and SET_NULL preserving the recorded outcome is exactly what
           ``models/bracket.py`` documents. This is also what makes the method
           re-entrant with the clinch — ``_clinch`` marks its leftover games
           ``CANCELLED`` *before* calling ``_cancel_match`` on each, so a clinched
           Bo3 does not get game 3's slot handed back.
        3. **Release means deleting the row**, not marking it ``CANCELLED``.
           ``next_game_number`` deliberately treats a cancelled number as
           consumed, so a ``CANCELLED`` row would free nothing. Mirrors
           :meth:`unlink_match`, which already deletes a ``SCHEDULED`` row: the
           audit log, not the row, is the record.

        Returns whether a slot was actually freed, so the caller can tell the
        entrants to rebook.
