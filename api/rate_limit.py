"""In-process rate limiting for the REST API.

The app runs single-worker (``uvicorn --workers 1``), so a per-process
fixed-window counter is sufficient and avoids an external dependency or shared
store. Requests are keyed by bearer token when present (so one client's tokens
are limited independently) and otherwise by client IP.

Attached as a dependency on the aggregating API router so it covers every REST
endpoint without touching the NiceGUI frontend mounted on the same app.
