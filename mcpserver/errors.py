"""Service-layer exception → MCP tool error translation.

The MCP analogue of ``api/dependencies.py::ServiceErrorRoute``. It has to live
inside the per-tool wrapper rather than at a single central seam, because the
SDK's ``Tool.run`` catches *every* exception and re-raises it as a bare
``ToolError`` — the type is gone by the time anything above the tool sees it.
So the mapping runs before the exception escapes the tool.

Errors reach the model as ``isError: true`` tool results (not JSON-RPC protocol
errors), which is what MCP intends for domain failures: the model reads them and
can recover. Only transport and authentication failures are HTTP-level.
