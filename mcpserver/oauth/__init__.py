"""OAuth 2.1 authorization server for the MCP surface.

Same origin as the resource server, which is the simple case: a client that
finds ``/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`` is pointed back here, and
discovers ``/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`` on the same host.

The routes come from the SDK's ``create_auth_routes`` — authorize, token,
register (RFC 7591), revoke, and the RFC 8414 metadata — so PKCE and the grant
mechanics are the SDK's well-tested implementation rather than ours. They are
appended to the *outer* app so they land at the origin root; mounted under the
FastMCP sub-app they would sit beneath ``/mcp`` where no client looks.

    """Put a route's ASGI app behind the shared per-minute limiter.

    Wraps at the ASGI layer, not the handler layer, because these routes are not
    all the same shape: the SDK hands ``/authorize`` a plain request handler and
    wraps the other three in ``CORSMiddleware``, which is an ASGI app. ``Route``
    normalizes both into ``Route.app``, so that is the one place a single wrapper
    fits.

    These routes hang off the outer app, not the ``/api`` router or the ``/mcp``
    endpoint, so neither of those limiters covers them — and they are the only
    unauthenticated writes the app exposes. ``/register`` in particular inserts a
    row per call and is open by design (RFC 7591 dynamic registration is what
    lets a client configure itself from a URL), so without a limit anyone can
    grow ``mcp_oauth_clients`` as fast as they can POST. ``/token`` and
    ``/revoke`` get the same bucket, which also caps guessing at a code or a
    refresh token.

    The same limiter as the REST API and ``/mcp``, so a client is throttled on
    one budget across all three rather than three independent ones.

    ``OPTIONS`` passes through: the SDK wraps most of these in CORS middleware,
    and a 429 on a preflight would break a browser client (MCP Inspector) for
    reasons it cannot report.
