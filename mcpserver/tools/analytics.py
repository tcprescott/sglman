"""Trend and capacity reports, at the admin gate its siblings already use.

These mirror the Admin → Reports tab, whose own gate is
``is_staff or tournament-admin or crew-coordinator`` — exactly what
``can_view_admin`` answers, so ADMIN is the faithful translation.

Two of them are reshaped rather than passed through. ``ReportsService`` builds
its payloads for a chart that is about to draw them, so they carry per-interval
and per-match detail — ``stream_room_utilization`` even returns ORM ``Match``
rows. Handing a model a few thousand interval entries buries the answer it was
asked for, so the tools return the shape a question actually needs: totals,
peaks, and where the pressure is.
