"""Online-play plumbing: seed presets, racetime rooms, and SpeedGaming sync.

Gates mirror ``api/routers/presets.py``, ``api/routers/race_room_profiles.py``,
``api/routers/race_rooms.py`` and ``api/routers/speedgaming.py``. Several of
those sit at ``require_api_actor`` because the *service* carries the real check
(``can_manage_presets``, ``ensure_can_manage_sync``) — mirroring the router's
gate rather than guessing a stricter one keeps the two surfaces answering the
same question, and the service still refuses a caller who lacks the role.

``list_race_rooms`` is the exception at STAFF, matching ``GET /race-rooms/open``:
its service read has no gate of its own, so the router's is the only one.
