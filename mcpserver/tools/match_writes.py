"""The write surface: match management and your own participation.

Scoped to exactly what ``api/routers/match_actions.py`` exposes, tool for tool.
That is the whole rule, and it is worth stating because the alternative — adding
whichever writes seemed useful — leaves two surfaces that drift apart and a
question with no answer when the next one is proposed. A write that belongs here
belongs in the REST router too, and vice versa.

Every tool is registered at ``Gate.ACTOR``, mirroring ``require_write_actor``:
holding a live token that was approved for writing is the bar at this layer, and
the real permission check is the service's own (``can_crud_match``,
``can_run_match``, ``can_confirm_match``, ``can_assign_match_stream``). The
service check is the one that knows about tournament admins, so duplicating it
here would only give the two surfaces a way to disagree.

The parity is not total, and the gap is worth knowing about. ``mcpserver`` has a
**membership floor** (``mcpserver/auth.py``) that refuses anyone holding no role
in the community, which the REST API has no equivalent of — a PAT is bound to
one community, so it never needed one. The floor governs the whole MCP surface,
reads included, so it is not something these tools introduced; but it does mean
the five self-service tools here (crew signup, acknowledge, watch) are out of
reach for a plain member who has joined a community without being given a role,
even though the same actions work for them on the web and through a PAT.
Widening the floor to membership is a decision about the read surface's
disclosure posture, not one to make quietly from here.

Ids are never guessed. Every tool takes ids a read tool returns — `match_id`
from `list_matches`, user ids from `list_users`, and `winner_id` from
`get_match`'s `players[].id`, which is the participation row rather than the
user.
