"""Remote MCP server for Wizzrobe, served at ``/mcp``.

A fourth entry surface alongside the web UI, the REST API, and the Discord bot:
it calls services, never repositories, and holds no business logic of its own.
The tools are read-only and typed, and are meant for Claude Desktop / Claude
Code connected by a community's organizers.

``main.py`` sees only :func:`mount` and :func:`session_lifespan`.

Mounting is order-sensitive and the ordering is not obvious: ``mount()`` must run
**before** ``frontend.init(app)``. NiceGUI mounts itself at ``/``, which would
otherwise swallow ``/mcp`` before our route is ever consulted.
