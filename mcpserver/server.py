"""FastMCP server construction.

Kept in a function rather than at module scope for a non-obvious reason:
``FastMCP.__init__`` calls ``configure_logging()``, which calls
``logging.basicConfig``. Constructing the server at import time would win the
race against ``main.py``'s own ``basicConfig`` and strip timestamps, levels and
logger names from every log line in the process. Building it from ``mount()``,
which runs after logging is configured, keeps our format.

Access to Wizzrobe, a tournament management platform. You can look up \
tournaments, matches, schedules, brackets and qualifiers, people, crew and \
volunteer assignments, equipment, seed presets, racetime and SpeedGaming \
integrations, audit history, engagement telemetry, and operational reports.

Most tools only read. If this connection was approved for write access you will \
also see tools that change data — scheduling and editing matches, running the \
match lifecycle, recording results, rolling seeds, and crew signups. They are \
the tools whose `readOnlyHint` is false. If you cannot see them, the person who \
connected this client approved it for reading only, and reconnecting is the \
only way to change that. Confirm with the user before a write that other people \
are relying on, and never guess at an id — read it back first.

Start with `whoami`. It reports which communities you belong to, what role you \
hold in each, which optional features each has enabled, and whether this \
connection may write — so you can avoid calling tools that would be refused.

Wizzrobe hosts many independent communities. Every tool except `whoami` and \
`list_tenants` takes a required `tenant` argument: the community's slug, as \
returned by `list_tenants`. A tool that reports `not_found` for a feature means \
that community has not enabled it, not that you asked incorrectly.

All times are returned in UTC. Each community chooses the timezone its \
members read them in, so convert before quoting a time to a person.\

    Every write is refused at the gate regardless, so this is not the security
    boundary — it is a context one. A read-only client offered nineteen tools it
    can never call spends tokens on them and plans work it cannot do, and the
    refusal arrives a round-trip after the model has already told the user it
    would reschedule their match.

    Listing runs inside the request's context (see ``mcpserver/asgi.py``), so
    the actor is the one whose token is being served. Outside a request — the
    SDK builds the list once while wiring itself up — there is no actor and the
