"""The single registration path for MCP tools.

Every tool is registered through :func:`register`, never through
``@mcp.tool()`` directly. That is the point: a tool cannot ship without an
explicit gate, because there is no other way to get one onto the server.
``tests/mcp/test_mcp_catalogue.py`` asserts the listed tools and
:data:`TOOL_SPECS` agree, so a tool added the wrong way fails the suite rather
than quietly serving unauthenticated data.

The wrapper is also where the tenant is bound and where service exceptions are
translated — both need to happen inside the tool call, and doing them here means
no individual tool can forget either.

A tool that changes data declares ``write=True``. That one flag drives three
things at once — the ``readOnlyHint`` clients read, the read-only-token refusal
in :func:`~mcpserver.auth.authorize`, and whether the tool is listed to a
read-only connection at all — so a write tool cannot be half-declared.

    The wrapper resolves the actor, resolves and binds the community named by

    service exception to a machine-readable tool error.

    Binding happens here — around the tool body, in one ``with`` — rather than
    in the ASGI layer, because an OAuth token is platform-wide and each call
    picks its own community. Using ``tenant_scope`` means set and reset are the
    same statement, so no tool can leak a community into the next call.

    ``destructive`` narrows ``write``: it marks the writes that remove something
    rather than adding or amending it, which is the distinction a client uses to
    decide how hard to ask the user before proceeding.
