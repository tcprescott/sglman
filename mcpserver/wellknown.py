"""RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata and the Bearer challenge.

Registered on the *outer* FastAPI app rather than through the SDK's
``create_protected_resource_routes``: that helper mounts the route inside the
FastMCP sub-app, which would serve the document at ``/mcp/.well-known/...``.
RFC 9728 §3.1 requires it at the origin root, and a client that cannot find it
there has no way to discover the authorization server.

Both the suffixed (``/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp``) and bare forms
are served. The suffixed form is what the spec derives from a resource URL with
a path; the bare one is what several clients request first.
