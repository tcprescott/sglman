"""Print every Discord DM and ephemeral reply the bot can send, with sample data.

Calls the real builders in ``application/utils/discord_messages.py`` (plain text)
and ``application/utils/discord_embeds.py`` (the colour-coded cards) — no bot, no
Discord connection, no database. This is how you "see" the Discord surface: the
copy and card shape are fully determined by these functions. Run from the repo
root:

    poetry run python .claude/skills/discord-ux/render_surface.py

Every notification is *sent* as an embed; the plain-text string still flows
through ``send_dm`` for the web-push mirror and the mock, so both are rendered
below. If a builder's signature changes, update the sample call to match.
See .claude/skills/discord-ux/SKILL.md for the full reconstruction workflow.
