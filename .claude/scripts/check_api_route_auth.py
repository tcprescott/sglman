"""
PostToolUse hook: every REST endpoint declares who may call it.

Auth in this API is **per-endpoint, not global**. The aggregating router in
``api/__init__.py`` carries only ``rate_limit`` and ``tenant_context_scope``, so
a route inherits no actor requirement from being mounted. Two mistakes follow
from that, and neither is visible in review — the endpoint works perfectly for
the author, who has a staff read-write token:

1. A route with no ``require_*`` dependency at all is world-readable behind
   nothing but the IP rate limiter.
2. A mutating route (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) that takes a read-side dependency
   (``require_api_actor``, ``require_admin``, ``require_staff``,
   ``require_super_admin``) is writable by a token its owner deliberately marked
   read-only. The write-side variants exist for exactly this and differ by one
   suffix, so the wrong one is an easy thing to type.

The convention is fully observed today and was enforced by nothing. A route may
satisfy it from its own parameters or from a router-level
``APIRouter(dependencies=[Depends(require_…)])``; both are read.

Exit 0 = clean / not applicable; exit 2 = violation (stderr explains).
