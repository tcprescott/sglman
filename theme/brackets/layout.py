"""Pure bracket layout walker — turns a persisted match graph into geometry.

No ORM, no NiceGUI: this module is the coordinate math behind the redesigned
bracket view (docs/plans/bracket-ui-plan.md, U2). It takes the light
:class:`MatchNode` projection of ``BracketMatch`` rows for **one section**
(winners+finals, or losers) and returns absolute pixel placements plus the elbow
connectors that join each match to the match its winner feeds — the only links a
conventional bracket draws.

The algorithm is Toornament's (a rooted tree on winner-links): a depth-first pass
assigns each leaf a sequential vertical *slot* and centers every parent on the
mean of its children's slots; slots and the round-derived column map to pixels.
Absolute positioning (rather than CSS grid) keeps connectors exact and the layout
robust to the irregular losers bracket, where a "minor" round match has a single
in-section feeder and a "major" round match has two.

Byes, placeholder source hints ("Winner of 7"), match numbering, and round names
are computed here too (all pure) so the card layer stays presentational. Pixel
constants mirror ``static/css/brackets.css``; changing one means changing both.
