"""Live bracket refresh — subscribe a bracket detail view to the event bus.

The public bracket page registers here at build time; the registration subscribes
a fast, non-blocking listener to the in-process :mod:`application.events` bus.
When a matching event fires, the listener invokes the caller's ``on_event``
callback — a *sync, non-blocking* function that schedules its own (debounced,
client-scoped) refresh. Subscriptions are released on client disconnect.

**Two event families, two ways of matching them.** ``BRACKET_*`` events carry a
``bracket_id`` and are matched exactly. ``MATCH_*`` events are what make the
bracket *live* (U2) — without them a card could hold the data and still never
repaint when its match starts or finishes — but their payloads carry no
``bracket_id``: resolving one would need a query, and this callback runs inside
``publish`` and must not block. They are matched on ``tournament_id``, which
every ``MATCH_*`` payload does carry. That is a slightly wider net — an unrelated
match in the same tournament repaints the view — and the right trade against a
query in a sync callback; the page's debounce absorbs the extra rebuilds.

Coalescing lives in the caller (the page debounces so a burst of events — e.g.
``BRACKET_MATCH_COMPLETED`` then ``BRACKET_COMPLETED`` from one report — collapses
into a single rebuild), keeping this module a thin, non-blocking bridge.
