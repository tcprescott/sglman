"""Presentation-side bridge for live updates pushed from the service layer.

Views call :func:`register_view` at build time with an async ``on_change`` handler.
Each registration captures the current NiceGUI ``Client`` and subscribes a callback
to a live channel — :mod:`application.events.match_live` by default, or
:mod:`application.events.check_in_live` for the check-in desk. When the channel
publishes, the callback schedules the handler inside the captured client's
context so UI mutations land in the right browser, with whatever arguments the
channel published. Subscriptions are cleaned up automatically when the client
disconnects.
