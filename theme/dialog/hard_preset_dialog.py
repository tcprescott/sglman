"""The player's private choice: play this match on the harder preset, or don't.

A dialog rather than a bare toggle, for one reason: a switch that silently
changes what you are about to play, and whose effect depends on somebody else's
answer you are not allowed to see, needs a sentence of explanation before it is
flipped. So the explanation and the two buttons live together, and the board
cell, the deep link and the Discord DM all open this same thing.

Every line of copy here is written to be readable by a player whose opponent
opted in and by one whose opponent did not, without either being able to tell
which they are. The only state it ever reports is the reader's own, plus the
unanimous result once there is nothing left to keep.
