"""The admin match editor's 'Bracket matchup' picker.

Split out of ``match_dialog`` to keep it under the file-length guideline. Plain
functions taking the :class:`BracketService` explicitly rather than a mixin —
only :class:`AdminMatchDialog` uses them, and the seam is one select plus one
reconcile step.

This is the counterpart of booking a game from the bracket view: staff who
scheduled a match through the ordinary editor can attach it to the matchup it
actually settles, so its result advances the bracket.
