"""A toast that survives a redirect.

``ui.notify`` enqueues a message on *this* client's outbox. A handler that
notifies and then calls ``ui.navigate.to`` unloads the document the toast would
have rendered in, so the message is written and never seen — the shape behind
nine unreachable failure strings across the OAuth link pages. ``ui.notify``
*during page build* is fine (the outbox buffers it until the websocket
connects), which is what makes the stash/drain pair below work: the message is
emitted while the **next** page is being built.

Use :func:`stash_notice` **only** for a notify that precedes a navigation. Where
a handler notifies and keeps rendering the same page — a table action that calls
``.refresh()`` — ``ui.notify`` is correct and this module is the wrong tool.

Three drain points, which is the honest cost of NiceGUI's page model here:
:meth:`theme.base.BaseLayout.render` (every ``/home/*``, ``/admin/*``,
``/volunteer/*`` page), :func:`theme.error_page.render_error_page` (a notice must
still show on the 403/404 a bad return path lands on), and ``/login``. There is
no single universal hook — ``protected_page``'s wrapper is not one, because
``/home`` is a bare ``@ui.page``.
