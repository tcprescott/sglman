"""The shared waiting panel — a spinner with a cat fact under it.

Used wherever someone is sitting in front of a blank screen waiting on work the
app cannot make faster: the OAuth round trip, a deferred tab build, a report
re-render. The fact is the same easter egg the empty states and the 404 page
carry, on the theory that a wait with something to read is a shorter wait.

:func:`waiting_screen` is the full-page form, for a route whose entire job is
the wait (``/oauth/callback``, ``/session/claim``). Those pages render outside
:class:`~theme.base.BaseLayout`, so it paints the brand itself — the in-scope
community's palette, or the platform's when there is no tenant — and holds the
panel on screen for :data:`MIN_WAIT_SECONDS` so the fact is readable rather than
a flash between two redirects.
