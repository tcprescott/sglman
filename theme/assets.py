"""Versioned URLs for everything under ``static/``.

Every stylesheet, script and worker the app links must go through
:func:`asset_url`. The app sends ``no-cache`` on its own static responses in
development only; in production nothing between the app and the reader is
obliged to revalidate a URL that never changes, so a browser or proxy holding a
previous deploy's ``brackets.css`` renders the current markup against stale
rules — the page keeps its markup and silently loses every rule added since.
Stamping the URL with the file's mtime changes the URL exactly when the file
changes, which is what makes a deploy visible to a client that already has the
old copy.

Paired with the ``Cache-Control`` policy in :mod:`frontend`: a stamped URL is
immutable and cached for a year, an unstamped one must revalidate.
