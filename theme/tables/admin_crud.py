    scoped query inside raises. NiceGUI logs that and swallows it, so the button
    fails in silence — the audit found eleven of the fifteen admin refresh
    controls dead this way, and their server-side errors were worse than the
    silence (a staff member's click logged *"Only Staff can view webhooks"*, and
    a community with SpeedGaming enabled logged *"not enabled for this
    community"*, both because the actor and the flags resolve against no
    tenant).

    live, and rebound around the call — the same shape as :func:`wire_tab_refresh`.

    ``refresh`` is a *callable*, not a coroutine, and is invoked inside the task
    (pass ``lambda: view.refresh()`` where the toolbar is built before the thing
    it refreshes exists — several tabs are laid out that way).
    That is what makes this work for a ``@ui.refreshable``'s ``.refresh()`` too:
    it returns an ``AwaitableResponse`` that must be awaited immediately or not
    at all, so building it a task early — the second failure the audit found, on
    the Equipment and Feedback tabs — raises before it refreshes anything.
