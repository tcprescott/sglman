"""Dialog-backed lifecycle callbacks for a ``MatchTableView``.

Presentation-layer glue: opens the shared dialogs, calls the match services,
reports failures through ``notify_error``, and refreshes the row it touched.
The admin Schedule tab and the proctor board both build their view from an
instance of this, so their lifecycle behaviour cannot drift.

Construction is two-phase because the dependency is circular — the view needs
the callbacks, and the callbacks need the view to refresh a row::

    handlers = MatchLifecycleHandlers(page_container, access=access)
    table_view = MatchTableView(columns=..., get_query=..., access=access, **handlers.callbacks())
    handlers.table_view = table_view

The read-only ``Match.get(id=..., tenant_id=require_tenant_id())`` loads here are
the sanctioned presentation-layer load-or-404 shape (CLAUDE.md, entry surfaces);
every *write* goes through a service.
