"""Generic mobile grid (card) support for admin / report ``ui.table``s.

Below Quasar's ``lt.md`` breakpoint a wide HTML table overflows a phone: columns
and every row-action button slide off the right edge behind a horizontal scroll.
The app's fix is to flip the table into Quasar *grid* mode
(``:grid="Quasar.Screen.lt.md"``) and register an ``item`` slot that stacks each
row as a card. The four purpose-built family tables (match, user, tournament,
equipment) ship bespoke cards (see ``match_grid.py``); **every other**
admin/report/player table should get its responsive card from this one helper so
the pattern stays uniform — and so the ``check_table_grid`` guardrail can prove a
new table has one.

The same ``columns`` list also decides what the *desktop* table paints:
``apply_column_visibility`` turns this app's ``{'hidden': True}`` convention into
Quasar's ``visible-columns`` prop, which is the only thing QTable actually reads.
``enable_mobile_grid`` applies it for you; a bespoke table that wires its own
``:grid`` prop calls it directly.

``enable_mobile_grid`` is column-driven (the same technique
``match_grid.render_grid_slot`` uses): it walks the ``columns`` list the desktop
table already uses, skips ``hidden`` and the ``actions`` column, and emits a
``.wiz-grid-card`` with a ``label / value`` row per remaining column plus an
optional right-aligned actions footer. A field that renders as a badge / chip /
icon on the desktop (via a ``body-cell-<field>`` slot) can pass a matching card
snippet through ``field_slots`` — Vue that reads ``props.row.<field>`` (note:
``props.row``, not the ``props.value`` the desktop cell slot sees). Anything
omitted falls back to the plain ``{{ props.row.<field> }}`` value.

Presentation-only: builds NiceGUI/Vue slot strings, no business logic.

    has no such column property at all and painted it regardless. Six admin
    tables carried an id column marked hidden purely so the row dict would keep
    the primary key for the row-action handlers — and every one of them printed
    that key as the first column on desktop while correctly hiding it on a
    phone.

    Quasar's actual mechanism is the ``visible-columns`` prop, so that is what
    this sets. The row dicts are untouched, which is the point: ``props.row.id``

    Adds the ``:grid`` prop and an ``item`` slot generated from ``columns``.
    Returns ``table`` so the call can chain.

    With ``table_key`` it *also* applies the viewer's saved desktop layout, and
    the ordering that makes that safe is owned here rather than left to the
    caller: the card slot is generated from ``columns`` **first**, exactly as it
    always was, and ``customize_table`` runs as the last statement. A table that
    goes through this helper therefore cannot get the order wrong, and the mobile
    card cannot be reached by a column preference.

    Args:
        table: the ``ui.table`` to make responsive.
        columns: the same column dicts passed to the table. ``hidden`` columns
            and the ``actions`` column are skipped in the card body.
        actions: raw inner HTML for the card's actions footer — typically the
            **same** row-action ``q-btn``s used in the ``body-cell-actions``
            slot (they emit ``$parent.$emit('event', props.row)`` and work
            unchanged inside the card). Empty ⇒ no footer.
        field_slots: optional ``{column_name: vue_snippet}`` overrides for
            fields that render as a badge/chip/icon; the snippet reads
            ``props.row.<field>``.
        row_click_event: when a desktop table wires a whole-row drill-down,
            pass its event name so the card is tappable too (emits
            ``$parent.$emit('<event>', props.row)``). Do not combine with
            ``actions`` — a button tap would also bubble the card click.
        breakpoint: Quasar Screen breakpoint (default ``lt.md``).
        table_key: this table's stable preference key (a ``TableKeys`` constant).
            Omit for a table that must not be customizable, and say why with a
            ``# table-prefs: exempt`` comment so the guardrail agrees.
        required: column names this table may never hide, overriding
            ``DEFAULT_REQUIRED`` (the row-action cells).
