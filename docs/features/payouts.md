# Prize payouts

Behind `FeatureFlag.PAYOUTS`, off by default. Prize money is SpeedGaming-shaped;
most communities never pay anyone.

Records what each placement of a tournament wins, and produces the block that
used to be typed by hand into an admin thread after every event.

## The model

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `Tournament.prize_pool` | The advertised pool. `NULL` until someone decides it |
| `Tournament.prize_bonus` | The leaderboard bonus, added to the pool before shares apply |
| `TournamentPayout` | One placement's share: `place`, `percentage`, optional `entrant` and `note` |
| `User.matcherino_username` | Where the money is sent. Global, self-entered, **not** unique |

Two properties of `TournamentPayout` carry most of the design:

**Amounts are computed, never stored.** A row holds a place and a percentage;
the money is `(prize_pool + prize_bonus) × percentage / 100`, quantized to the
cent, worked out every time it is read (`PayoutService.amount_for`). The pool
moves throughout an event, and a stored amount would be a second source of truth
that drifts the moment it does. Rounding is per row, so a split whose
percentages sum to exactly 100 can total a cent under the pool — every line pays
what it says it pays, and the remainder is the organizer's to place.

**Ties are first-class.** The unique key is `(tournament, place, entrant)`, not
`(tournament, place)`. SGL's ALTTPR 2025 paid two third places at 10% each;
halving one 20% third place would hide the arithmetic from the admin checking
it. Postgres treats `NULL`s as distinct, so several unnamed rows can sit at the
same place while the split is drafted, and once both are named the key stops one
person being paid twice at one place.

## Who may edit

`AuthService.can_manage_payouts(user, tournament)` — staff, a super-admin, or
that tournament's admin. Reads are gated with the writes: an unannounced split
is admin data, so a plain member gets a 403 rather than a preview of who is
being paid what. A tournament admin sees only their own events; the Payouts tab
lists exactly what `PayoutService.list_overview` returns, so it never offers a
row whose controls would refuse.

## The service

`application/services/payout_service.py`. Every public method carries
`@requires_feature(FeatureFlag.PAYOUTS)`.

| Method | Does |
|---|---|
| `list_overview(actor)` | Every tournament the actor may manage, with pool, total, place count and whether every place is named |
| `get_split(tournament_id, actor)` | The rows, with amounts |
| `set_pool(tournament_id, pool, bonus, actor)` | The two `Tournament` columns. `None` clears a value, which is not the same as zero |
| `set_split(tournament_id, rows, actor)` | Replaces the whole split in one transaction |
| `set_entrant(payout_id, user_id, actor)` | Names a winner on a drafted row |
| `export_block(tournament_id, actor)` | The text to paste |

Validation raises `ValueError`: shares may not sum above 100 (below is fine — an
unallocated remainder is real), a place is at least 1, a share is above 0, and
neither pool nor bonus may be negative.

`set_pool` and `set_split` / `set_entrant` audit and publish through
`AuditService.write_and_publish` as `tournament.prize_pool_updated` and
`tournament.payout_updated`. `get_split` and `export_block` deliberately publish
nothing: pasting a block into a thread changes no state.

## The export

```
Total prize pool: $1000.00
Bonus: $100.00

1st place - Jemgold (jemgold#100234): 50% / $550.00
2nd place - blueshell (blueshell#204871): 30% / $330.00
3rd place - greenpotion (no Matcherino handle): 10% / $110.00
3rd place - (unassigned): 10% / $110.00
```

A row with no entrant reads `(unassigned)`; an entrant with no handle is called
out rather than left blank, because a silently missing handle is what stalls a
payout run and the reader of the block is the person who can go and ask for it.

## Surfaces

| Surface | |
|---|---|
| Admin → Payouts (`pages/admin_tabs/admin_payouts.py`) | The tournament table, the pool and split dialogs, and **Copy for Matcherino** |
| Profile → Matcherino handle (`pages/home_tabs/player_edit_info.py`) | Its own card, deliberately apart from the OAuth-verified Challonge/Twitch/racetime rows so it never reads as verified. Hidden where the community lacks the feature |
| `GET/PUT /api/tournaments/{id}/payouts`, `PUT /api/tournaments/{id}/prize-pool` | Money serialises as strings |
| MCP `get_tournament_payouts` | Read only. The MCP write surface is opt-in at consent, and prize money is not where to extend it first |
