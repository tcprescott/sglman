"""Static, heavily-cached public bracket views — the link you send spectators.

The NiceGUI bracket pages (``pages/brackets.py``) are excellent for the people
*running* a tournament: a match dialog, zoom, and a live repaint driven by the
event bus. They are also a websocket per open tab, on an app that runs a single
worker (docs/scaling-roadmap.md). A finals stream that puts a bracket link in
front of a few thousand viewers is a load problem the interactive page cannot be
made to solve — the socket *is* the feature.

These two routes are the answer: the same bracket, rendered server-side into a
plain HTML document with no client framework and no socket at all.

* ``GET /live/tournament/{tournament_id}/brackets`` — the stage index
* ``GET /live/brackets/{bracket_id}`` — one stage

They are plain FastAPI routes rather than ``@public_page`` because a NiceGUI
page is precisely what is being avoided; everything ``public_page`` does that
still applies is done here explicitly — tenant resolution (from the middleware
that already ran), the ``BRACKETS`` feature gate, and the anonymous-visitor
rule that a DRAFT or CANCELLED stage is not public (``is_visible``). Page-view
telemetry is deliberately **not** recorded: a DB write per spectator request is
the cost this surface exists to avoid, and the interactive pages still report.

Caching is two layers over one render:

* in-process (:class:`HtmlPageCache`), invalidated by ``BRACKET_*``/``MATCH_*``
  events for the tenant so a reported result shows up on the next request, with
  a TTL as the backstop for time-derived state no event announces; and
* HTTP — ``Cache-Control: public`` plus a strong ``ETag``, so a reader whose page
  reloaded itself on the meta-refresh timer usually gets a 304 with no body, and
  any CDN in front of the app can serve the burst without touching the app at
  all. The responses depend on nothing per-visitor (no session read, no
  ``Set-Cookie``), which is what makes ``public`` safe here.
