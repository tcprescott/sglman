"""Challonge provider config for the profile 'Connected accounts' section.

Lets a player verify-link their Challonge identity (one-time OAuth, scope
``me``) so they can be matched to bracket participants for scheduling. Rendered
(alongside the other providers) by :func:`render_connected_accounts_section`,
which hides any provider whose integration isn't configured.
