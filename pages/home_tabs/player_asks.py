"""Your opponent asked to move a match: the request, and an Agree for it.

A card above the board rather than a column on it, for the same reason the
"Waiting on you to pick a time" card is: it is the reader's next action, and a
cell on a ten-column board is where actions go to be scrolled past.

The opponent DM asks them to press Agree. The web had no Agree at all, so the
push notification copy of that DM, which has no Discord button under it, asked
for something nobody could do.
