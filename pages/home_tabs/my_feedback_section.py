"""A person's own feedback submissions, on their profile.

The missing half of the feedback loop. Someone types a question into the
sidebar form — *"who do I ask about getting my racetime name fixed?"* — and
until now that was the last they ever saw of it: staff could mark it reviewed,
but nothing said so anywhere the submitter could look, and there was no list of
what they had sent. The queue was one-directional by construction.

Read-only on purpose. This is not a reply thread — staff answer in whatever
channel the community actually uses — it is the acknowledgement that the thing
was received and looked at, which is what its absence was costing.

Presentation only: one service read, no ORM.
