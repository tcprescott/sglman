"""The tournament room's seeds board — the one page a token opens.

A room PC is a shared machine in a public room; nobody signs in on it, and it
still has to show the seed for the next match. So this route authorizes on an
unlisted :class:`~models.RoomToken` instead of a session, and shows exactly one
thing: matches whose seed is rolled and which nobody has started yet.

``GET /t/<slug>/room/<token>/seeds`` — **inside** the tenant prefix on purpose.
The middleware there has already resolved the community and bound the display
clock, so the token only has to authorize; outside the prefix this page would
have to resolve a tenant from the token itself and enter ``tenant_scope`` by
hand, and every scoped read would raise until it did.

**Chromeless.** No header, drawer or bottom nav — the board is the whole page,
because a machine nobody signs in on has nowhere to navigate to and no session
to sign out of. A floating dark-mode toggle is the one control that survives.

**Read-only.** Rolling and re-rolling stay signed-in staff work: an anonymous
token that could spend randomizer API calls and replace the seed for a match
about to be played is not a trade worth making for a machine sitting in a room
the public walks through.
