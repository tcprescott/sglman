"""Transport seam for the racetime bot runtime.

The connection loop (:mod:`racetimebot.connection`) is deliberately transport-
agnostic: it owns health tracking, backoff, heartbeats, and tenant-routed event
dispatch, and delegates the actual network I/O to a :class:`RacetimeTransport`.
Two implementations exist:

* :class:`RealRacetimeTransport` — a real ``aiohttp`` client-credentials token
  fetch against racetime.gg, then a liveness loop. This proves the bot's OAuth
  credentials and tracks health against the live service. The full bot websocket
  protocol (per-race action handlers) is the integration surface later PRs build
  on; this PR's job is to *connect and track state*, not to open rooms for real
  matches.
* :class:`~racetimebot.mock.MockRacetimeTransport` — a scripted fake used under
  ``MOCK_RACETIME`` and in tests, driving a room lifecycle without any network.

Errors are split into two kinds so the loop can react correctly:

* :class:`RacetimeAuthError` — credentials rejected (HTTP 401/invalid client).
  The loop stops retrying: hammering a bad secret only earns rate limits.
* :class:`RacetimeTransientError` — anything retryable (network blip, 5xx,
  timeout). The loop backs off exponentially (capped) and reconnects.
