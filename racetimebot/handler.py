"""Per-connection race-room event handler.

The handler is the routing seam between the transport's raw room events and the
tenant-scoped business layer. It follows the presentation-layer rule (call
services, never repositories) and does three jobs:

1. **Tenant routing.** An inbound event carries only the room slug — no tenant.
   The handler resolves slug → room via the deliberately-unscoped
   :meth:`RacetimeRoomService.get_by_slug`, then binds ``room.tenant_id`` with
   :func:`tenant_scope` so every downstream write lands in the right tenant.
2. **Crash containment.** Each event is dispatched inside a ``try/except`` so a
   handler that raises can never take down the connection or its siblings.
3. **Delegation.** The tenant-scoped work is handed to an injected *lifecycle*
   object (duck-typed ``async handle_event(room, event)``). This PR ships a
   status-only lifecycle; the room-lifecycle PR injects the richer service that
   attaches seeds and captures results.

The connection acts as the **system user**; the lifecycle is what actually
performs the writes/audits under that identity.
