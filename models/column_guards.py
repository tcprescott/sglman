"""Column-fit guards — reject a value that cannot be stored, as a ``ValueError``.

Two whole classes of production 500s originate at the same place: a value that
is *valid Python* but does not fit its column.

* A string longer than its ``CharField(max_length=N)``. Tortoise catches this
  itself, but raises :class:`tortoise.exceptions.ValidationError`, which is
  **not** a ``ValueError`` — so it sails past every ``except ValueError`` in the
  UI and past ``ServiceErrorRoute``'s ``ValueError -> 400``, and surfaces as a
  500 (REST) or a silently-dropped edit (a NiceGUI event handler).
* An integer outside its column's range. ``IntField`` is Postgres ``INT``
  (32-bit) and does not range-check at all, so the value reaches the driver and
  comes back as an ``asyncpg`` ``DataError`` — again a 500.

Neither is reproducible under the test suite's SQLite backend: SQLite has no
``VARCHAR`` length enforcement and stores 64-bit integers, so the suite is blind
to both.

The fix is one guard installed on every field, using Tortoise's own
``Field.validators`` extension point, so it holds for all models — including
future ones — without 62 hand-written checks. Two details are load-bearing:

* The guard raises :class:`FieldValueError`, a plain ``ValueError``. Tortoise's
  ``Field.validate`` re-wraps anything deriving from its own ``ValidationError``
  (losing the subclass), so raising a ``ValueError`` is what lets the error reach
  callers intact — and a ``ValueError`` is exactly what every entry surface
  already handles: a ``ui.notify`` on the web, a 400 over REST, an
  ``invalid_request`` tool error over MCP.
* The built-in ``MaxLengthValidator`` is *replaced* rather than supplemented, so
  a too-long string raises once, with our type and message.

This is a backstop, not a licence to skip validation: a service that knows a
sensible bound (a match duration, a shift's slot count) should still say so, with
a message that means something to the reader. What this guarantees is that a
bound nobody wrote still fails as a user error rather than as a crash.
