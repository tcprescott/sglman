"""Persistence for the MCP server's OAuth 2.1 authorization server.

Both models are **global** — no ``tenant`` foreign key. An OAuth grant is
platform-wide: it authenticates a :class:`~models.User`, and the community a
given MCP tool call operates in is named by the call itself, not baked into the
credential. The access token the flow ultimately issues is an
:class:`~models.ApiToken` row with ``origin='oauth'`` and ``tenant=NULL``.
