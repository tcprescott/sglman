    Per tenant, not on the global :class:`User`: asking SpeedGaming Live for a
    seat near the stage must not tell another community's staff anything. One
    row per person per community; withdrawing keeps the row (status
    ``WITHDRAWN``, ``details`` cleared) so the staff notes survive as history,
    and asking again reopens it as ``NEW``.

    Editing the details of an ``ARRANGED`` request leaves it ``ARRANGED`` and
    sets ``changed_since_arranged`` (with ``arranged_details`` holding what staff
    arranged against) until staff review the change.

    ``details`` is the requester's own text and ``staff_notes`` is staff-only;
    neither ever leaves the app (audit rows, events, REST and MCP carry ids and
    status only).
