## Checklist

- [ ] Model change: migration generated (`poetry run aerich migrate && poetry run aerich upgrade`) and committed, and `docs/reference/data-model.md` updated
- [ ] Layer boundaries respected: no ORM writes in `pages/`/`theme/`/`api/`/`discordbot/`/`mcpserver/`; business logic in services, data access in repositories
- [ ] Tenant scoping: new/changed queries are scoped (`scoped(...)` reads, `tenant_id=` on writes), and a leak test covers any new tenant-scoped model
- [ ] Docs updated under `docs/`, and `scripts/seed_dev.py` extended so the change is visible in a dev environment
